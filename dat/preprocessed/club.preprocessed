  Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) -is an open international ice hockey league in Eurasia founded in 2008 on basis of Russian Ice Hockey Superleague. It encompasses 24 clubs including 21 Russian, 1 Belorussian, 1 Kazakh and 1 Latvian club.   
  The system dynamics methods of J. Forrester, the mathematical theories of hierarchical multilevel systems, cybernetic models and the concept of organic growth of M. Mesarovic and E. Pestel, the methods and theories of simplification, equilibrium, homeostasis and convergence that were used in Meadows's report, the principles of planetary interdependence, humanistic social order and planning presented in the reports of the club of Rome paved   the way and led scholars and politicians to unconditional recognition of the need to examine the social aspect of the global development as well as to put a question of systematic research of global society formation.   
  He lunged, lashing out with the candle stand like a club.   
  Langdon had to smile as the threesome moved deeper into the church." Leigh, "he whispered," you lie entirely too well. "    Teabing's eyes twinkled." Oxford Theatre club.    They still talk of my Julius Caesar.   
  Loved the snappy reviews and the witty cartoons and the feeling of being admitted to a special, members-only club for readers.   
  So Lily had stepped up and thrown a little party to save us all the $150 tickets to some club or, even worse, any sort of ridiculous thoughts of actually freezing in Times Square.   
  I am on Fifty-eighth Street, closer to Park Avenue, right in front of the New York Sports club.   
  I had penthouse suites reserved for them at the Shore club, the Albion, and the Delano within seven minutes of her first phone call, figuring she couldn't possibly be serious — I mean, my god, it was a Saturday night.   
  Attend the tennis club where she'd receive her private lessons so that I could fetch water and, if required, white scarves in case she schvitzed? A head-to-toe athletic outfit complete with bootleg workout pants, zip-up hooded jacket (cropped to show off my tummy, natch), a $185 wife-beater to wear under it, and suede sneakers — all by Prada.   
  Bosch and Edgar took the two leather club chairs opposite.   
  A man in a red shirt and plaid pants was in the trap, flailing with a club at an unseen ball.   
  He then climbed out of the trap, holding his club with both hands still locked in their grip, a posture that suggested he had just hit the ball.   
  Edgar angrily shoved the club he had been using into his bag and gave Bosch his dead-eye look.   
  He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.   
  It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.   
  It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.   
  Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.   
  The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over ― and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.   
  Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.   
  Why don't Jamie, Daddy and I all club together and get you a proper new big suitcase and a set of wheels? '   
   Men, he claims, view themselves as permanently on some sort of sexual ladder with all women either above them or below them. If the woman is 'below' (i.e. willing to sleep with him, very keen on him) then in a Groucho Marx kind of way he does not want to be a member of her 'club.' This whole mentality depresses me enormously but   Tom said not to be naïve and if I really love Daniel and want to win his heart I have to ignore him and be as cold and distant to him as possible.   
  The night of the burglar alarm and screaming row in my street was a result of a remark from Sloaney Woney, who claimed she had seen Jeremy with a girl at the Harbour club who sounded suspiciously like the witch I saw him with all those weeks ago.   
   'You should make the most of being single while it lasts, Bridge, ' she said. 'Once you've got kids and you've given up your job you're in an incredibly vulnerable position. I know Jeremy thinks my life is just one big holiday, but basically it's extremely hard work looking after a toddler and a baby all day, and it doesn't stop.When   Jeremy comes home at the end of the day he wants to put his feet up and be nurtured and, as I imagine all the time now, fantasize about girls in leotards at the Harbour club.   
   'Sorry, ' he chirped, 'I'm taking Jerome to the PACT party at the Groucho club.'   
  I had told them, too, that they were never to go into the Black Cat Cafe, which the townspeople considered their private club.   
  But that still didn't make crucifixion a country club.   
  This was my club now, since I had been busted down to Townie.   
  I done run out the door, an he be chasin me all over the parade grounds, an even thru the Officer's club an the Motorpool.   
  I did not have no address for Jenny cept a post office box, but I did have her letter with the name of the little place where she said she was playin with her band, The Cracked Eggs.    It was called the Hodaddy club.    I tried to walk there from the train station, but I kep gettin lost, so I finally took a taxicab.   
  Anyway, after a wile, I got bored an went down a alley an roun to the back of the club.   
  That afternoon Jenny took me to meet the other guys in the band an she tell them I play the harmonica like heaven itsef, an why don't they let me set in with them at the club tonight.   
  Ever day I practice some, an ever night the band play at the Hodaddy club.   
  When we was doin our act at the Hodaddy club, ever so often Jenny would pass by me an muss up my hair, or run her fingers down the back of my neck.   
  One night after we is finished the first set at the Hodaddy club, Mose, the drummer for The Cracked Eggs, take me aside an say, “Forrest, you is a nice clean-cut feller an all, but they is somethin I want you to try that I think will make you play that harmonica better.”   
  At night I'd go out between sets at the Hodaddy club an set in the little alley an look up at the stars.   
  After that, I got to rassle Juno the Giant, who weighed four hundrit pounds an dressed in a leopard skin an carried a papier-mache club.   
  I even gave a talk on my Cambridge days at a rather pathetic English Ladies club, to which she belonged.   
  The day after their discussion, Bronowski had had lunch at the Faculty club with a group of the higher officials of the university, including, of course, the president.   
  He sat down in a club chair and drew a list of points to be discussed from his briefcase.   
  Who would care to haunt half-remembered lumps of matter (he did not know that Jacques lay buried under six feet of snow in Chute, Colorado), uncertain itineraries, a club hut which some spell prevented him from reaching and whose name anyway had got hopelessly mixed with" Draconite, "a stimulant no longer in production but still advertised on fences, and even cliff walls. 
  He belonged to a big club composed of people who collected things like that.   
  Billy stopped skating, found himself at a lectern in a Chinese restaurant in Ilium, New York, on an early afternoon in the autumn of 1957.    He was receiving a standing ovation from the Lions club.    He had just been elected President, and it was necessary that he speak.   
  Billy was on his way to a Lions club luncheon meeting.   
  The speaker at the Lions club meeting was a major in the Marines.   
  He was simply having lunch with the Lions club, of which he was past president now.   
  Billy had heard about this racket from a speaker at the Lions club two weeks before — a man from the Better Business Bureau.   
  He wore suitable clothes for a suitably hot day in the country, namely, a candy-striped suit over a mauve flannel shirt and piqué waistcoat, with a blue-and-red club tie and a safety-goldpinned very high soft collar (all his trim stripes and colors were a little displaced, though, in the process of comic strip printing, because it was Sunday).   
  At a nice Christmas party for private librarians arranged under the auspices of the Braille club in Raduga a couple of years earlier, emphatic Miss Vertograd had noticed that she and giggling Verger, with whom she was in the act of sharing a quiet little cracker (tugged apart with no audible result, nor did the gold paper frilled at both ends yield any bonbon   or breloque or other favor of fate), shared also a spectacular skin disease that had been portrayed recently by a famous American novelist in his Chiron and described in side-splitting style by a co-sufferer who wrote essays for a London weekly.   
  As he was dressing, a messenger brought him a note from Lord C. (he was a cousin of one of Van's Riverlane schoolmates), in which generous Dick proposed to substitute for his debt an introduction to the Venus Villa club to which his whole clan belonged.   
  On February 5, 1887, an unsigned editorial in The Ranter (the usually so sarcastic and captious Chose weekly) described Mascodagama's performance as 'the most imaginative and singular stunt ever offered to a jaded music-hall public.' It was repeated at the Rantariver club several times, but nothing in the programme or in publicity notices beyond the definition 'Foreign eccentric' gave any indication either of the   exact nature of the 'stunt' or of the performer's identity.   
  Rumors, carefully and cleverly circulated by Mascodagama's friends, diverted speculations toward his being a mysterious visitor from beyond the Golden Curtain, particularly since at least half-a-dozen members of a large Good-will Circus Company that had come from Tartary just then (i.e., on the eve of the Crimean War), three dancing girls, a sick old clown with his old speaking goat, and one   of the dancers' husbands, a make-up man (no doubt, a multiple agent), had already defected between France and England, somewhere in the newly constructed 'Chunnel.' Mascodagama's spectacular success in a theatrical club that habitually limited itself to Elizabethan plays, with queens and fairies played by pretty boys, made first of all a great impact on cartoonists.   
  The Captain was a first-rate shot, Johnny said, and member of the Do-Re-La country club.   
  To put it bluntly, the boy had sought to solace his first sexual torments by imagining and detailing a project (derived from reading too many erotic works found in a furnished house his grandfather had bought near Vence from Count Tolstoy, a Russian or Pole): namely, a chain of palatial brothels that his inheritance would allow him to establish all over 'both hemispheres of   our callipygian globe.' The little chap saw it as a kind of fashionable club, with branches, or, in his poetical phrase, 'Floramors, ' in the vicinity of cities and spas.   
  Resident female physicians, good-looking and young ('of the American secretarial or dentist-assistant type'), would be there to check the intimate physical condition of 'the caresser and the caressed' (another felicitous formula) as well as their own if 'the need arose, ' One clause in the Rules of the club seemed to indicate that Eric, though frenziedly heterosexual, had enjoyed some tender ersatz fumblings with   schoolmates at Note (a notorious preparatory school in that respect): at least two of the maximum number of fifty inmates in the major floramors might be pretty boys, wearing frontlets and short smocks, not older than fourteen if fair, and not more than twelve if dark.   
  The candidates for every floramor were to be selected by a Committee of club Members who would take into consideration the annual accumulation of impressions and desiderata, jotted down by the guests in a special Shell Pink Book. 'Beauty and tenderness, grace and docility' composed the main qualities required of the girls, aged from fifteen to twenty-five in the case of 'slender Nordic   dolls, ' and from ten to twenty in that of 'opulent Southern charmers.' They would gambol and loll in 'boudoirs and conservatories, ' invariably naked and ready for love; not so their attendants, attractively dressed handmaids of more or less exotic extraction, 'unavailable to the fancy of members except by special permission from the Board.' My favorite clause (for I own a photostat of that poor   boy's calligraph) is that any girl in her floramor could be Lady-in-Chief by acclamation during her menstrual period.   
  Demon's father (and very soon Demon himself), and Lord Erminin, and a Mr Ritcov, and Count Peter de Prey, and Mire de Mire, Esq., and Baron Azzuroscudo were all members of the first Venus club Council; but it was bashful, obese, big-nosed Mr Ritcov's visits that really thrilled the girls and filled the vicinity with detectives who dutifully impersonated hedge-cutters, grooms, horses,tall   milkmaids, new statues, old drunks and so forth, while His Majesty dallied, in a special chair built for his weight and whims, with this or that sweet subject of the realm, white, black or brown.   
  'Dear friends, we surely all agree There's almost nothing worse to see Than some repulsive little bum Who's always hewing chewing-gum. (It's very near as bad as those Who sit around and pick the nose.) So please believe us when we sayThat chewing gum will never pay; This sticky habit's bound to send The chewer to a sticky end. Did any of you ever   know A person called Miss Bigelow? This dreadful woman saw no wrong In chewing, chewing all day long. She chewed while bathing in the tub, She chewed while dancing at her club, She chewed in church and on the bus; It really was quite ludicrous! And when she couldn't find her gum, She'd chew up the linoleum, Or anything that happened near — A   pair of boots, the postman's ear, Or other people's underclothes, And once she chewed her boy-friend's nose. She went on chewing till, at last, Her chewing muscles grew so vast That from her face her giant chin Stuck out just like a violin. For years and years she chewed away, Consuming fifty bits a day, Until one summer's eve, alas, A horrid business came   to pass. Miss Bigelow went late to bed, For half an hour she lay and read, Chewing and chewing all the while Like some great clockwork crocodile. At last, she put her gum away Upon a special little tray, And settled back and went to sleep — (She managed this by counting sheep). But now, how strange! Although she slept, Those massive jaws of hers   still kept On chewing, chewing through the night, Even with nothing there to bite. They were, you see, in such a groove They positively had to move. And very grim it was to hear In pitchy darkness, loud and clear, This sleeping woman's great big trap Opening and shutting, snap-snap-snap! Faster and faster, chop-chop-chop, The noise went on, it wouldn't stop   . Until at last her jaws decide To pause and open extra wide, And with the most tremendous chew They bit the lady's tongue in two. Thereafter, just from chewing gum, Miss Bigelow was always dumb, And spent her life shut up in some Disgusting sanatorium. And that is why we'll try so hard To save Miss Violet Beauregarde From suffering an equal fate   . She's still quite young. It's not too late, Provided she survives the cure. We hope she does. We can't be sure.'   
  Membership in the Automobile club of Southern California as Mrs. Garvin S. Hastings; membership card in a yacht club at Balboa Beach, and three or four credit cards.   
  " If you're registered at the hotel, you sign a chit.    If you're not registered, but are a member of the beach club, you can also sign».    "You promised to introduce me to the mystery," Mason said, as they moved toward the lunchroom.   
  The portion of the skull in question had received a very heavy blow from some heavy object.    " Such as a club?    "A hammer?   
  A few days later, however, namely on Monday, February 16, I was introduced to the old poet at lunch time in the faculty club.   
  In a skit performed by a group of drama students I was pictured as a pompous woman hater with a German accent, constantly quoting Housman and nibbling raw carrots; and a week before Shade's death, a certain ferocious lady at whose club I had refused to speak on the subject of" The Hally Vally "(as she put it, confusing Odin's Hall with the title   of a Finnish epic), said to me in the middle of a grocery store," You are a remarkably disagreeable person.   
  The Crashaw club had paid me to discuss   
  Both were very old friends of the Shades; one had a daughter, president of Sybil's club, and this is the Dr.   
  A haughty and morose captive, he was caged in his rose-stone palace from a corner turret of which one could make out with the help of field glasses lithe youths diving into the swimming pool of a fairy tale sport club, and the English ambassador in old-fashioned flannels playing tennis with the Basque coach on a clay court as remote as paradise. 
  Earlier, at lunch in the Faculty club, Prof. H.'s guest, a decrepit emeritus from Boston, whom his host described with deep respect as" a true Patrician, a real blue-blooded Brahmin "(the Brahmin's grandsire sold braces in Belfast), had happened to say quite naturally and debonairly, in allusion to the origins of a not very engaging new man in the College Library," one of   the Chosen People, I understand "(enunciated with a small snort of comfortable relish); upon which Assistant Professor Misha Gordon, a red-haired musician, had roundly remarked that" of course, God might choose His people but man should choose his expressions. "   
  One day, however, in the lounge of the Faculty club where I lolled surrounded by a number of my colleagues, I had to put up with a particularly embarrassing onset.   
  " Help me, Charlie, to get out of here, "he pleaded." Foot gone to sleep.    Sybil is at a dinner meeting of her club. "    " A suggestion, "I said, quivering." 1 have at my place half a gallon of Tokay.   
  As he considered the case he felt a slight biliousness and decided he'd have to lay off Chinese food for a week or two; anyway, with two dinner parties coming off this week, and the Gourmet's club next Tuesday, it shouldn't be too hard to endure.   
  The music stopped, and the couples on the dance floor of the small but fashionable supper club—one of the few which existed in Burlington—began drifting back to their tables.   
  Afterward they had gone to the Maisonette, a discreet and pleasantly appointed night club on Fifth Avenue.   
  When inviting him to deliver a Friday-evening lecture at Cremona, some two hundred versts west of Waindell, Pnin's academic perch since 1945, the vice-president of the Cremona Women's club, a Miss Judith Clyde, had advised our friend that the most convenient train left Waindell at 1.52 p.m., reaching Cremona at 4.17; but Pnin, who, like so many Russians, was inordinately fond of   everything in the line of timetables, maps, catalogues, collected them, helped himself freely to them with the bracing pleasure of getting something for nothing, and took especial pride in puzzling out schedules for himself, had discovered, after some study, an inconspicuous reference mark against a still more convenient train (Lv. Waindell 2.19 p.m., Ar. Cremona 4.32 p.m.); the mark indicated that Fridays   , and Fridays only, the two-nineteen stopped at Cremona on its way to a distant and much larger city, graced likewise with a mellow Italian name.   
  Humanities Hall, where, however, Ornithology and Anthropology also lurked, was connected with another brick building, Frieze Hall, which housed the dining-rooms and the Faculty club, by means of a rather rococo openwork gallery: it went up a slope, then turned sharply and wandered down toward a routine smell of potato chips and the sadness of balanced meals.   
  Whether the incomparable comedian danced in the sun with chapleted nymphs near a waiting cactus, or was a prehistoric man (the supple cane now a supple club), or was glared at by burly Mack Swain at a hectic night-club, old-fashioned, humourless Pnin remained indifferent.   
  His wife, a sweet woman of simple antecedents, referred to him at her club as 'Professor Blorenge'.   
  It was all built, of course, around the Pninian gesture and the Pninian wild English, but Cockerell also managed to imitate such things as the subtle degree of difference between the silence of Pnin and the silence of Thayer, as they sat motionlessly ruminating in adjacent chairs at the Faculty club.   
  'And now, ' he said, 'I am going to tell you the story of Pnin rising to address the Cremona Women's club and discovering he had brought the wrong lecture.'   
  She was, obviously, one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club or bridge club, or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul; women who are completely devoid of humor; women utterly indifferent at heart to the dozen or so possible subjects of a parlor conversation, but very particular about the rules of such conversations, through the sunny cellophane of   which not very appetizing frustrations can be readily distinguished.   
  Never had I thought that the rather ridiculous, through rather handsome Mrs. Haze, with her blind faith in the wisdom of her church and book club, her mannerisms of elocution, her harsh, cold, contemptuous attitude toward an adorable, downy-armed child of twelve, could turn into such a touching, helpless creature as soon as I laid my hands upon her which happened on the   threshold of Lolita's room whither she tremulously backed repeating" no, no, please no. "   
  Lo who had gone to play tennis at Linda's country club had telephoned she might be a full half hour late, and so, would I entertain Mona who was coming to practice with her a scene from The Taming of the Shrew.   
  But all feel that primo, you should have your family doctor tell her the facts of life and, secundo, that you allow her to enjoy the company of her schoolmates' brothers at the Junior club or   
  That he had visited with his uncle in Ramsdale? ―oh, years ago―and spoken at Mother's club, and had tugged and pulled her, Dolly, by her bare arm onto his lap in front of everybody, and kissed her face, she was ten and furious with him?   
  The box with the baits was under the stem of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside.   
  I have the two oars and the tiller and the short club."   
  I am too old to club sharks to death.   
  But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.   
  He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the stern for the club.   
  The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark's broad head.   
  The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark's broad head.    He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down.    But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.   
  The old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness.   
  He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club.   
  He clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it was gone.   
  But now the Giant was stamping forward, stooping low and swinging his club.   
  "Her mother belonged to the same club we did," I said.   
  I was feeling in the mood for one myself.    " We can go in the club car.    All right?   
  Thank you so much, though, dear, "she said.    " Anyway, the club car's most likely closed.    It's quite late, you know.   
  They had this night club, the Lavender Room, in the hotel.   
  They probably thought movie stars always hung out in the Lavender Room when they came to New York, instead of the Stork club or El Morocco and all.   
  There isn't any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk.   
  Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her.   
  Ernie's is this night club in Greenwich Village that my brother D. B. used to go to quite frequently before he went out to Hollywood and prostituted himself.   
  He had this big chateau and all on the Riviera, in Europe, and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club.   
  Even the guys that belong to the goddam Book-of-the-Month club stick together.   
  Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right hand. Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund did not like going past it.   
  Now he was moving his feet. A moment later he lifted his club off his shoulder, rubbed his eyes and said,   
  ” Then he strode to the gate himself and bang—bang—bang—went his huge club.   
  Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath; and at the same moment all war-like creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch's house rushed madly on the enemy lines, dwarfs with their battleaxes, dogs with teeth, the Giant with his club (and his feet also crushed dozens of the foe), unicorns with their horns, centaurs with swords   and hoofs.   
  The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club.   
  Pietro, or at least the soldier resembled Pietro, the head waiter at the University club, Pietro the soldier examined Krug's pass and said in cultured accents:   
  What a strange trick of chance, this masterpiece of esoteric thought endearing itself at once to the middle-class reader and competing for first honours during one season with that robust satire Straight Flush, and then, next year, with Elisabeth Ducharme's romance of Dixieland, When the Train Passes, and for twenty-nine days (leap year) with the book club selection Through Towns and Villages   , and for two consecutive years with that remarkable cross between a certain kind of wafer and a lollipop, Louis Sontag's Annunciata, which started so well in the Caves of St Barthelemy and ended in the funnies.   
  She was still in the bathroom when the man from the AngliskiД club brought a meat pie, a rice pudding, and her adolescent buttocks.   
  'A person who has never belonged to a Masonic Lodge or to a fraternity, club, union, or the like, is an abnormal and dangerous person.   
  While I was writing the notes which form this book, and after I had taken the trouble | of translating myself such passages as I required, The; Readers' club in New York published a completely new translation of Dead Souls, made by B. G. Guerney.   
  The edition is marred however by two things: a ridiculous foreword contributed by one of the members of the club s editorial committee: and the alteration of the authentic title to Chichikov's I Journeys, or Homelife in Old Russia.   
  They had shaken hands and he had saluted and gone out to the staff car where the old man was waiting asleep and in that car they had ridden over the road past Guadarrama, the old man still asleep, and up the Navacerrada road to the Alpine club hut where he, Robert Jordan, slept for three hours before they started.   
  Pretty soon he'll feel bad because he can't join the Jockey club, I guess, he thought.   
  Pauvre Пабло.    Il а manque son" Jockey club ".    Эта мысль развеселила его.   
  It was there the clock was set in the wall and it was in the buildings under the arcade that the club of the fascists was.   
  And under the arcade on the sidewalk in front of their club was where they had their chairs and tables for their club.   
  So he walked down the line and pushed through to where Don Federico was standing and said, 'With your permission, and hit him a great blow alongside of the head with a club.   
  - The drunkards were handing around bottles of anis and cognac that they had looted from the bar of the club of the fascists, drinking them down like wine, and many of the men in the lines were beginning to be a little drunk, too, from drinking after the strong emotion of Don Benito, Don Federico, Don Ricardo and especially Don Faustino.   
  He had a rude way of speaking and he was undoubtedly a fascist and a member of their club and he sat at noon and at evening in the cane chairs of their club to read El Debate, to have his shoes shined, and to drink vermouth and seltzer and eat roasted almonds, dried shrimps, and anchovies.   
  Kill them!    club them!    Kill them! ― and he pushed me aside with his two arms and I could see nothing.   
  Let me see. ― But he just kept shaking his hands and arms against the bars and shouting, 'Kill them!    club them!    club them!   
  Everyone generally followed Ratslayer with their eyes wherever he appeared, because of his height, and those who were seeing him for the first time also because the centurion's face was disfigured: his nose had once been smashed by a blow from a Germanic club.   
  Here the rest of the staff realized that there was no way around the singing, and they, too, had to sign up for the club.   
  It was, then, before the beginning of his second college year that K, having come to the capital for a brief vacation and taken modest lodgings at the so-called Cabinet Members' club, met, at the very first court reception, the crown prince, a boisterous, plump, indecently young-looking charmeur, defying one not to recognize his charm.   
   See that sign 'longside the road there? Service club. Luncheon Tuesday, Colmado Hotel? Welcome, brother. That's a Service club.   
   "No, thank you." Jessie took charge. "We gonna show you 'bout the sanitary unit fust, an' then if you wanta, we'll sign you up in the Ladies' club an' give you duty.   
  I been thinkin' maybe we ought to get up a turkey shootin' club an' have meetin's ever' Sunday."   
  The heavy club crashed into the side of his head with a dull crunch of bone, and Casy fell sideways out of the light.   
   Tom leaped silently. He wrenched the club free. The first time he knew he had missed and struck a shoulder, but the second time his crushing blow found the head, and as the heavy man sank down, three more blows found his head.   
  And then a club reached his head, a glancing blow.   
  He had lunched at the Pitt (which, I understood, was a kind of club, probably with horsey pictures on the walls and very old waiters asking their eternal riddle: thick or clear?). He had played fives (whatever that may be) or some other tame game, and then had had tea with two or three friends; the talk had hobbled along between crumpet and pipe   , carefully avoiding anything that had not been said by others.   
  She wanted Sebastian to join a literary club and mix with other authors. And once or twice Sebastian got into a starched shirt and got out of it again without having uttered one single word at the dinner arranged in his honour.   
  On the contrary, that announcement of his book seemed to me a token of happiness, and I imagined him standing in a warm cheerful room at some club, with his hands in his pockets, his ears glowing, his eyes moist and bright, a smile fluttering on his lips, and all the other people in the room standing round him, holding glasses of port,and   laughing at his jokes.   
  In the beginning of November, he had lunch with Sheldon at Sheldon's club and was so taciturn that his friend wondered why he had come at all.   
  He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfirnbul's head clean off with a wooden club.   
  Fifteen years later (remembering that Lessing had got to know Mendelssohn over a chessboard) he founded the St. Petersburg Chess club, which was opened in January, 1862, existed through spring, gradually declining, and would have failed of itself had it not been closed down in connection with the "St. Petersburg fires."   
  'Little gemiitlich Germany', ach, brick cottages, ach, the kiddies go to school, ach, the peasant doesn't beat his horse with a club!..   
  He wrote this letter at the club, cold sober, and mailed it to New York asking her to write him at the office in Paris.   
  The truth of the matter was that Melanie had diplomatically managed to amalgamate the Lady Harpists, the Gentlemen's Glee club and the Young Ladies Mandolin and Guitar Society with the Saturday Night Musical Circle, so that now Atlanta had music worth listening to.   
  Unable to agree with the Gentlemen's Glee club as to the program for their next recital, the ladies had waited on Melanie that afternoon and announced their intention of withdrawing completely from the Musical Circle.   
  Her father died, she moved to another street. She stopped seeing her friends, knitted the little bonnets in fashion, and gave cheap French lessons at some ladies' club or other. In this way her life dragged on to the age of thirty.   
  "I beg your pardon, Comrades. I don't understand what is wanted of us. Are we expected to go in for politics? If so, when are we going to study? We've got to finish the Gymnasium. If it was some sports society, or club that was being organised where we could gather and read, that would be another matter. But to go in for   politics means taking the risk of getting hanged afterwards. Sorry, but I don't think anybody will agree to that."   
  At the club Tonya's fine clothes were so conspicuous among all the faded tunics and shabby blouses that Pavel was deeply embarrassed. The young people treated her as an outsider, and Tonya, conscious of their disapproval, assumed a contemptuous, defiant air.   
  "All right, let him be," Okunev agreed. "Come on, Pavel, let's go to Solomenka. There's a meeting at the club tonight. Nobody knows you're back yet. Think what a surprise they'll get when we announce: 'Korchagin has the floor! ' You're a great lad, Pavel, for not dying. What good would you be to the proletariat dead?" And Okunev threw his arm   around his friend and piloted him down the corridor.   
  I'll come back toward evening and we'll go to the club together.   
  "I've been looking for the damn thing for three days! Couldn't imagine where it had got to. Now I remember. Volyntsev made a lampshade out of it the other day and then he himself searched for it high and low." Okunev folded the document carefully and stuffed it under the mattress. "We'll put everything in order later on," he said reassuringly."Now   for a bite and then off to the club. Pull up to the table, Pavel!"   
  At the club Okunev took Korchagin through the back entrance behind the stage. In the corner of the spacious hall, to the right of the stage near the piano sat Talya Lagutina and Anna Borhart with a group of Komsomols from the railway district. Volyntsev, the Komsomol secretary of the railway shops, was sitting opposite Anna. He had a face as ruddy as an   August apple, hair and eyebrows the colour of ripe corn. His once black leather jacket was extremely shabby.   
  He conducted the meeting sprawled in the only soft armchair in the room which had been brought from the club.   
  A PUBLIC MEETING OF WORKING YOUTH WILL BE HELD TODAY AT THE club. THE SPEAKERS WILL BE LISITSYN, CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, AND KORCHAGIN, ACTING SECRETARY OF THE KOMSOMOL DISTRICT COMMITTEE. AFTER THE MEETING A CONCERT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE PUPILS OF THE NINE-YEAR SCHOOL.   
  From saddle to desk, and from desk to the common where squads of young military trainees diligently drilled, then the club and the school and two or three committee meetings ― such was the daily round of the Military Commissar of Battalion Two. Often enough his nights were spent on horseback, Mauser at his side, nights whose stillness was broken by a sharp "Halt,who   goes there?" and the pounding of the wheels of a fleeing cart laden with smuggled goods from beyond the border.   
  But they won't leave God be, and they're always trying to take the church away and use it for a club. Now that's no good, it's turned the old folks against them. But on the whole they're not so bad. If you ask me, though, they make a big mistake taking in all the down-and-outs in the village, the ones who hire   out, or who can't make a go of their farms. They won't have anything to do with the rich peasants' sons. "   
  The very walls of the railwaymen's club seemed to groan under the pressure of the human mass.   
  In the evenings the room shared by Ebner and Korchagin became a sort of club.   
  " And here's an invitation to the Artists' club. We shall have to go this time.   
  Rex left immediately after dinner, reflected what he should do next and dropped into a gambling-club. A straight flush (which had not happened to him for ages) bucked him up somewhat.   
  Fairly soon he made friends with his downstairs neighbor Darwin, as well as with various men at the soccer field, the club, and the dining halL   
  Darwin spent the night in one of those charming two-room flats provided by clubs for bachelors, and Darwin's club was one of the smartest and staidest in London, with overstuffed armchairs, glossy magazines, and thick silent rugs.   
  Here Martin felt the rush of a radiant torrent that had burst through the locks, he remembered the tricky cross he had collected so nicely, remembered that the Rose business was settled, that there was a banquet at the club that evening, that he was healthy and strong, that tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and for many, many days more life would go on   , replete with all kinds of happiness. All this overwhelmed him in one dizzy instant, and he merrily seized Sonia in his arms together with the cushion she had clutched at, and started kissing her moist teeth, her eyes, her cold nose, and she struggled, and kicked, and her black, violet-scented hair kept getting in his mouth; at last, laughing loudly, he dropped her   on the sofa. Here the door was pushed open. At first a foot appeared, then, laden with goodies, Darwin entered. He tried to close the door with his foot but dropped a paper sack out of which tumbled meringues.   
  She considered Martin an ideal roomer: he was seldom at home, did not receive guests, and never used the bath (the latter was amply replaced by the shower at the tennis club and the lake in Grunewald).   
  But Sonia, ah, Sonia, From his nighttime thoughts about the glorious and dark expedition, from his literary chats with Bubnov, from his daily labors at the tennis club, he would return to her again and again and hold a match over the gas stove for her, whereupon, with a loud gush, the blue flame would extend all its claws.   
  Often after supper she would put on her raincoat and leave, and Martin, after strolling aimlessly from room to room for a time, would leave too and walk slowly to the streetcar stop, hands deep in trouser pockets; at the opposite end of Berlin he would whistle tenderly under the window of a cabaret dancer whom he had met at the tennis club. 
  This time it was excellent, and in it the protagonist, a young German, wore the tie Martin had on that day, pale gray with pink stripes (the treasured relic of a Cambridge club), which Bubnov, though seemingly engrossed in his grief, had appropriated as would a deft thief who wipes his tears with one hand while removing a man's watch with the other. 
  Sometimes I stopped in at the AngloAmerican club and sat in a deep leather-cushioned chair in front of the window and read the magazines.   
  I put the paper back on the rack and left the club.   
  A British major at the club told me the Italians had lost one hundred and fifty thousand men on the Bainsizza plateau and on San Gabriele.   
  We were alone in the club sitting back in one of the big leather sofas.   
  The photograph appeared on an October day soon after his first unforgettable performance in a chess club.   
  The gray-haired Jew who used to beat Chigorin, the corpse of his aunt's admirer muffled in flowers, the sly, gay countenance of his father bringing a magazine, and the geography teacher petrified with the suddenness of the mate, and the tobacco-smoke-filled room at the chess club where he was closely surrounded by a crowd of university students, and the clean-shaven face   of musician holding for some reason the telephone receiver like a violin, between shoulder and cheek, all this participated in his delirium and took on the semblance of a kind of monstrous game on a spectral, wobbly, and endlessly disintegrating board.   
  Young Luzhin began to frequent an eminently quiet chess club that had trustfully blossomed forth at the very height of civil chaos, and in spring, together with Valentinov, he disappeared, once more abroad.   
  He played in Manchester, where the decrepit champion of England forced a draw after a two-day struggle; in Amsterdam, where he lost the deciding game because he exceeded the time limit and his opponent, with an excited grunt, banged down the stop of Luzhin's clock; in Rome, where Turati triumphantly unleashed his celebrated debut; and in many other cities which for him were   all identical, hotel, taxi, a hall in a café or club.   
  She asked the chambermaid she met in the corridor to wake Luzhin in an hour, and descending the stairs soundlessly she set off through sunlit streets to the tennis club, and caught herself still trying not to make a noise or any sharp movements.   
  It was not a notebook, but a small, folding chessboard of morocco leather. Luzhin immediately recalled that it had been given to him at a club in Paris, all the participants in that tournament were given this knickknack, some firm's advertisement, not simply a souvenir from the club.   
  Luzhin meanwhile fixed his motionless and expressionless gaze on an eggshell-white plaque with a black inscription, Veritas, but Valentinov immediately swept him farther and lowered him into an armchair of the club variety that was even more tenacious and quaggy than the car seat.   
  Dreyer smiled, wiggling his toes." Enough playing on public courts, "he said." Next spring I'll join a club. "   
  Ostap passed an island of lights-the railway workers' club- checked the address from a piece of paper, and halted in front of the record-keeper's house.   
  "We're just coming to that. The stuffed bear with dish went to the police station No. 2. The Shepherd Boy tapestry went to the art treasure collection; the Shepherd Girl tapestry to the water-transport club; the Aubusson, Tekke and Khorassan carpets to the Ministry of Foreign Trade.   
  The newspaper's third column -which used to bound with such sceptical headlines as "No sign of a club", "Around the weak points", "Inspections are needed, but what is the point of shine and long tails?""Good and… bad", "What we like and what we don't", "Deal with the saboteurs of education", and "It's time to put an end to red tape" -began to present   readers with such sunny and encouraging headings at the top of Flywheel's reports as "How we are living and how we are building", "Giant will soon start work", "Modest builder", and so on, in that vein.

  As soon as everything was over, and Comrade Gavrilin was sitting in his lilac Fiat waiting for Treukhov to issue final instructions so that they could then drive together to the club, a Ford station-wagon containing newsreel cameramen drove up to the depot gates.   
  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR    THE AUTOMOBILE club    In the editorial offices of the large daily newspaper Lathe, located on the second floor of the House of the Peoples, material was hurriedly being got ready for the typesetters.   
  But besides not getting the ten kopeks, he was buttonholed by Avdotyev, a member of the Young Communist League, who proposed that the poet should join the Automobile club.   
  "Listen, Alexander Josifovich, wait a moment, it's a serious matter," said Avdotyev, sitting down on the editor's desk. "We've formed an automobile club. Would the editorial office give us a loan of five hundred roubles for eight months?"   
  For the moment the club only consisted of the organizer, but Avdotyev did not enlarge on this.   
  You hand over the bonds to the club.

  Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks's dancing-club.   
  Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks's dancing-club.    The dancing-club was a bal musette in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Genevieve.    Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there. One night a week it was the dancingclub.   
  Some one had put it in the American Women's club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table.   
  He gave us his card, with his address in London and his club and his business address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope.   
  They thought I was hell's own shakes of a soldier.    Give away medals in a night club.    Dashing fellow. "   
  They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen's blue smocks, and red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles.   
  " Where did you stay up? "    " We danced at some club. "    " I got sleepy, "I said.   
  The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by.   
  “Well, while I was in Chicago at the Union League club, I met a young man who is related to us, a cousin of you three children, by the way, the eldest son of my brother Asa, who is out in Denver now, I understand.   
  “He's only a bell-hop in the Union League club in Chicago, at present, but a very pleasant and gentlemanly sort of a boy, I will say.   
  The Clyde whom Samuel Griffiths described as having met at the Union League club in Chicago, was a somewhat modified version of the one who had fled from Kansas City three years before.   
  Then two months after he had received his mother's first letter and while he was deciding almost every day that he must do something, and that forthwith, he chanced one day to deliver to the Union League club on Jackson Boulevard a package of ties and handkerchiefs which some visitor to Chicago had purchased at the store, for which he worked.   
  Upon entering, who should he come in contact with but Ratterer in the uniform of a club employee. He was in charge of inquiry and packages at the door.   
  And forthwith, he began to explain that just at present there wasn't anything in the Union League, but that he would talk to Mr. Haley who was superintendent of the club — and that if Clyde wanted to, and Mr. Haley knew of anything, he would try and find out if there was an opening anywhere, or likely to be, and if so, Clyde could   slip into it.   
  Ratterer, having some time before established himself as day assistant to the club staff captain, and being on good terms with him, was able to say to the latter that he knew exactly the man for the place — Clyde Griffiths — then employed at the Great Northern.   
  For to this club from day to day came or went such a company of seemingly mentally and socially worldly elect as he had never seen anywhere before, the self-integrated and self-centered from not only all of the states of his native land but from all countries and continents.   
  But here was no sex — no trace of it.    No women were admitted to this club.    These various distinguished individuals came and went, singly as a rule, and with the noiseless vigor and reserve that characterizes the ultra successful.   
  When he was within the precincts of the club itself, he felt himself different from what he really was — more subdued, less romantic, more practical, certain that if he tried now, imitated the soberer people of the world, and those only, that some day he might succeed, if not greatly, at least much better than he had thus far.   
  “Where?    “Casino Golf club.    “Oh, too far.   
  “Well, now, Clyde, as you have seen, it has been charged here that you took Miss Alden to and out on that lake with the sole and premeditated intent of killing her — murdering her — finding some unobserved and quiet spot and then first striking her with your camera, or an oar, or club, or stone maybe, and then drowning her.   
  I took dinner usually at the Yale club―for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day―and then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.   
  A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence.   
  "We must have a game of singles," remarked the Colonel, slapping his son on the back with gusto as the latter, baring his teeth, pulled on his white, crimson-striped club blazer with a violet emblem on one side.   
  He passed out under the archway, at last no longer―thank goodness! ―disfigured by the gungrey of its search-light.'They'd better put a search-light on to where they're all going, ' he thought, 'and light up their precious democracy! ' And he directed his steps along the club fronts of Piccadilly   
  Since the death of his brother-in-law Montague Dartie, in Paris, which no one had quite known what to make of, except that it was certainly not suicide―the Iseeum club had seemed more respectable to Soames.   
  Val saw a large form, and a face clean-shaven, bull-like, a little lowering, with sardonic humour bubbling behind a full grey eye; he remembered it dimly from old days when he would dine with his father at the Iseeum club.   
  And soon after he gave her his blessing, received a kiss, and left her for his bookmaker's, the Iseeum club, and Victoria station.   
  " No; but you can―to my club. "   
  " No; but you can―to my club. "    She had a club; she was wonderful!    " Did you pump Holly? "he muttered.   
  Stratton Street, where her club was, adjoined Devonshire House.   
  It would be the merest chance that she should be at her club.   
  Jon moved on, and turning the corner into Piccadilly, ran into Val Dartie moving toward the Iseeum club, to which he had just been elected.   
  Except to lunch now and then at the Hotch-Potch with his father, he had never been in a London club.   
  They were all now married, except George, confirmed to the Turf and the Iseeum club; Francie, pursuing her musical career in a studio off the King's Road, Chelsea, and still taking ‘lovers' to dances; Euphemia, living at home and complaining of Nicholas; and those two Dromios, Giles and Jesse Hayman.   
  Why, old Nicholas was still a Free Trader, and a member of that antediluvian home of Liberalism, the Remove club—though, to be sure, the members were pretty well all Conservatives now, or he himself could not have joined; and Timothy, they said, still wore a nightcap.   
  He found his ‘tutor, ' not indeed at the Oxford and Cambridge, but at the Goat's club.   
  They dined quietly, in style and taste; left the club smoking cigars, with just two bottles inside them, and dropped into stalls at the Liberty.   
  Soames read, on Iseeum club paper, these words: ‘You will not get chance to insult in my own again.   
  I might find out at his club.”   
  On hearing from the hall porter at the Iseeum that Mr. Dartie had not been in to-day, he looked at the trusty fellow and decided only to ask if Mr. George Forsyte was in the club.   
  Saturday to Monday was spent at his club in town—curious reversal of customary procedure, based on the deep and careful instinct that while working so hard he needed sea air to and from the station twice a day, and while resting must indulge his domestic affections.   
  Mr. SOAMES FORSYTE THE SHELTER, CONNOISSEURS club, MAPLEDURHAM. ST. JAMES'S.   
  He looked longingly at the windows of the Iseeum club, where he had often eaten of the best with his father!   
  It was decades since he had dined anywhere in London save at his club or at a private house.   
  They had time to browse about the sections of the city which had peculiar charms for them as Bohemians after dark―the levee, as a certain section of the Chicago River was called; Gambler's Row in South Clark Street; the Whitechapel club, as a certain organization of newspaper men was called, and other places frequented by the literati and the more talented of the   newspaper makers.   
  He had no compunctions about using these weapons, much as a strong man might use a club.   
  Eugene looked more like a Bohemian or a club man now that he had been worked upon by Summerfield.   
  He had not heard of Eugene until toward the end of his search, but one day in the Union club in Philadelphia, when he was talking to a big advertising agent with whom he did considerable business, the latter said:   
  It gave her a club wherewith to strike her lord―a chain wherewith to bind him.   
  His business engagements had necessitated considerable personal expenditures, his opportunity to enter the Baltusrol Golf club, the Yere Tennis club, the Philadelphia Country club, and similar organizations had taken annual sums not previously contemplated, and the need of having a modest automobile, not a touring car, was obvious.   
  A third told him of his record with Summerfield, and through a fourth man who knew Eugene, and who was having him to lunch at the Hardware club a few weeks later, Colfax had a chance to meet him without appearing to be interested in him in any way.   
  In a boat club at Tompkinsville she had her motor boat, used mostly by her boy; in her garage at Grimes Hill, several automobiles.   
  In looking about for a club wherewith to strike Eugene, White discovered this.   
  A summer resort of really imposing proportions, with hotels, casinos, pagodas, resident sections, club houses, a wide board or stone walk along the ocean, and possibly a gambling center which should outrival Monte Carlo, had long since occurred to him as something which might well spring up near New York.   
  As a matter of fact, after two automobile rides to the nearest available position on the site of the future resort and a careful study of the islands and the beach, Eugene devised a scheme which included four hotels of varying sizes, one dining and dancing casino, one gambling resort after the pattern of Monte Carlo, a summer theatre, a music pavilion, three lovely   piers, motor and yacht club houses, a park with radiating streets, and other streets arranged in concentric rings to cross them.   
  After dinner it was proposed by Kinroy that he and his friends and Suzanne go to a dance which was being given at a club house, near the government fortifications at The Narrows, where they spread out into the lower bay.   
  A car was called, and they sped to the club to find it dimly lighted with Chinese lanterns, and an orchestra playing softly in the gloom.   
  He could see her only as he danced with her at the boat club, as he sat with her in the swing at Daleview.   
  Once, not long after he and she had danced at the boat club together, she came with her mother to see how Angela was, and Eugene had a chance to say a few words to her in the studio, for they came after five in the afternoon when he was at home.   
  Suzanne was there, out riding when he came, but, as he learned from Mrs. Hadley, there was a dance on at a neighboring country club. Suzanne with a number of others was going.   
  Three or four islands had been filled in and the club house of a minor yacht club had been constructed, but still the Sea Island Development Company had a long way to go before even a third of its total perfection would be in sight.   
  Just now it was without important fuel or ammunition; and this assignment of Cowperwood, with its attendant crime, so far as the city treasury was concerned, threatened, as some politicians and bankers saw it, to give it just the club it was looking for.   
  Still he used law as he would use any other trap or weapon to rid him of a human ill; and as for lawyers, he picked them up as he would any club or knife wherewith to defend himself.   
  He was a member of an athletic club which had an attractive building in the city, and a fine country club, where he went occasionally to enjoy the swimming-pool and the Turkish bath connected with it.   
  He had heard the rumor concerning Aileen from various sources — other members of the club, for one — and had ventured to repeat it in Pethick's presence.   
  It was a nine days' wonder in the club, and was only kept out of the newspapers by the most strenuous efforts on the part of the friends of both parties.   
  Callum was so outraged on discovering that there was some foundation for the rumor at the club in a general rumor which prevailed that he tendered his resignation, and never went there again.   
   The next Kit heard of the Klondike was when he dropped into the club that afternoon, and, in an alcove off the library, encountered his uncle.   
   "Ah, you forget. There is one in the jinks room of this very club."   
   What happened in the next half hour Smoke never distinctly remembered. At the end he emerged exhausted, sobbing for breath, his jaw sore from a first-blow, his shoulder aching from the bruise of a club, the blood running warmly down one leg from the rip of a dog's fangs,   
   Its team-mates, angered, fell upon it with their fangs, and Smoke was forced to club them off with the heavy butt of his whip.   
   DOOLITTLE. The poor man's club, Governor: why shouldnt I?   
  He saw quite calmly, as through a club windowpane, all that must follow.   
  But poor Armstrong was killed with a giant's club, a great green club, too big to be seen, and which we call the earth.   
  It was true, the old-timers who worked for him, in order to be saved from the club of the organized owners, were made foremen over the gang of chechaquos; but this, with Daylight, was a matter of heart, not head.   
  Ain't it funny, to go around with brass knuckles and a big club breaking folks' heads and taking their money away from them until I've got a pile, and then, repenting of my ways, going around and bandaging up the heads the other robbers are breaking?   
  He dabbled in little things at first― "stalling for time," as he explained it to Holdsworthy, a friend he had made at the Alta-Pacific club.   
  Daylight himself was a member of the club, and Holdsworthy had proposed him.   
  Such things did happen, he knew, for he heard the chaffing gossip of the club; but he did not think much of such men and felt sorry for the girls.   
  The latter had made great capital out of the forced resignation, but Daylight had grinned and silently gone his way, though registering a black mark against more than one club member who was destined to feel, in the days to come, the crushing weight of the Klondiker's financial paw.   
  But he was the only man with whom Daylight was really intimate, though he was on terms of friendliest camaraderie with the rough and unprincipled following of the bosses who ruled the Riverside club.   
  He was after a number of men in that club, and, whenever opportunity offered, he reached out for them and mangled them.   
  " No man ever courted a woman by holding a threatened proposal over her head like a club.   
  You know, I'm the janitor and corresponding secretary of the Down-and-Out club.   
  Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his head; and though it stunned him and crushed him down, it incited him.   
  " Goin' to the Lotus club dance to-night?   
  The girls of the Lotus club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with questions, and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley's were glad that Martin came no more.   
  "Each of their arms is a wooden club," answered the little man, "and I'm sure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes.   
  The bound Gargoyle's arms extended far out beyond its head, so by grasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club.   
  Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a club until he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clustered so thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing his arms.   
  Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them: his Pall Mall lodgings, the Diogenes club, Whitehall―that is his cycle.   
  About fifty men who were in the room rushed upon the police in a grand break for personal liberty.    The plain-clothes men had to do a little club-swinging.    More than half the patrons escaped.   
  You stroll out to pluck a Sweet William in the park — and lo! bandits attack you — you are ambulanced to the hospital — you marry your nurse; are divorced — get squeezed while short on U. P. S. and D. O. W. N. S. — stand in the bread line — marry an heiress, take out your laundry and pay your club dues — seemingly all in the wink   of an eye.   
  Then he stepped into the automobile, reclined upon the cushions, and said two words to the chauffeur:    "club, Henri."   
  But if I had a club they would run a-way as soon as they saw me."   
  But if I had a club they would run a-way as soon as they saw me."    "Haven't you a club?" asked Dorothy.    "No," said Tiktok.   
  “I take plenty: I never use the lift at the club.”   
  “Capital position, not two minutes from me,” said the voice of Swithin, “and from my rooms I can drive to the club in eight.”   
  Old Jolyon told him to put his dress clothes out; he was going to dine at the club.   
  The club which old Jolyon entered on the stroke of seven was one of those political institutions of the upper middle class which have seen better days.   
  He was too old to be a Liberal, had long ceased to believe in the political doctrines of his club, had even been known to allude to them as ‘wretched stuff, ' and it afforded him pleasure to continue a member in the teeth of principles so opposed to his own.   
  He naturally despised the club that did take him.   
  He ordered dinner, and sat down in the very corner, at the very table perhaps! (things did not progress much at the ‘Disunion, ' a club of almost Radical principles) at which he and young Jolyon used to sit twenty-five years ago, when he was taking the latter to Drury Lane, during his holidays.   
  “Mr. Jolyon Forsyte still a member here?”    “Yes, sir; in the club now, sir.    What name?”   
  Young Jolyon, on the point of leaving the club, had put on his hat, and was in the act of crossing the hall, as the porter met him. He was no longer young, with hair going grey, and face—a narrower replica of his father's, with the same large drooping moustache—decidedly worn.   
  His club was closed for cleaning; his Boards in recess; there was nothing, therefore, to take him into the City.   
  When she walked up the steps of the town hall a sharp cold struck her face and breast. She lost breath, and her legs stiffened. There, in the middle of the square, walked Rybin! His hands were bound behind his back, and on each side of him a policeman, rhythmically striking the ground with his club. At the steps stood a crowd waiting in   silence.   
  The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association, and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of Manuel's treachery.   
  The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.   
  At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.   
  He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did not understand.   
  This time he was aware that it was the club, but His madness knew no caution.   
  A dozen times he charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.   
  But the man, shifting the club from right to left, cooly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward.   
  He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club.   
  He had learned the lesson, and in all his afterlife he never forgot it.    That club was a revelation.    It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,   
  Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated.   
   I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker Street   until evening. It was nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.   
  You have been at your club all day, I perceive."   
   It was the end of November and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood   in connection with the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil club, while in the second he had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her step-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York. 
  As the country was too young for club-life, the masculine portion of the community expressed its masculinity by herding together in the saloons, ―the ministers and missionaries being the only exceptions to this mode of expression.   
  And Sid Winslow, Pacific Coast journalist, had made his acquaintance at the Wanderers' club shortly after he landed from the United States revenue cutter which had brought him down from the north.   
  Do not imagine for a moment that I care a hang; but he is very much regretted at tennis-parties, and for my own sake I've told a plausible lie at the club…. "   
  In the shade of a green pagoda a bebuttoned officer of the law was resting, his arms folded, his club at rest in his belt.   
  On Fifth Avenue were loungers―a few wealthy strollers, a gentleman in evening dress with his lady on his arm, some club-men passing from one smoking-room to another.   
  He already felt a longing to go to restaurants, clubs, dinner-parties, anniversary celebrations, and he felt flattered at entertaining distinguished lawyers and artists, and at playing cards with a professor at the doctor's club.   
  One evening, coming out of the doctors' club with an official with whom he had been playing cards, he could not resist saying:   
  And through some strange, perhaps accidental, conjunction of circumstances, everything that was essential, of interest and of value to him, everything in which he was sincere and did not deceive himself, everything that made the kernel of his life, was hidden from other people; and all that was false in him, the sheath in which he hid himself to conceal the truth ― such,for   instance, as his work in the bank, his discussions at the club, his 'lower race', his presence with his wife at anniversary festivities – all that was open.   
  When a dramatic club or a reading-room or a tea-shop was licensed in the town, he would shake his head and say softly:   
   I have told the circumstances of the stranger's arrival in Iping with a certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious impression he created may be understood by the reader. But excepting two odd incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club Festival may be passed over very cursorily. There were a number of skirmishes with Mrs.Hall   on matters of domestic discipline, but in every case until late in April, when the first signs of penury began, he overrode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment.   
   The facts of the burlgary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the small hours of Whit-Monday ― the day devoted in Iping to the club festivities. Mrs. Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn, with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom   had opened and closed.   
   Members of the club, who had attended church in the morning, were splendid in badges of pink and green, and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon.   
  Tom sung out: Me and Huck's found Jubiter Dunlap's corpse all by ourselves with a bloodhound, after everybody else had quit hunting and given it up; and if it hadn't a been for us it never WOULD 'a' been found; and he WAS murdered too―they done it with a club or something like that; and I'm going to start in and find   the murderer, next, and I bet I'll do it!   
  He said he was going to prove that Uncle Silas was SEEN to kill Jubiter Dunlap by two good witnesses, and done it deliberate, and SAID he was going to kill him the very minute he hit him with the club; and they seen him hide Jubiter in the bushes, and they seen that Jubiter was stone-dead.   
  LEM BEEBE, sworn, said―" I was a-coming along, that day, second of September, and Jim Lane was with me, and it was towards sundown, and we heard loud talk, like quarrelling, and we was very close, only the hazel bushes between (that's along the fence); and we heard a voice say, 'I've told you more'n once I'd kill you, 'and   knowed it was this prisoner's voice; and then we see a club come up above the bushes and down out of sight again and heard a smashing thump and then a groan or two: and then we crope soft to where we could see, and there laid Jupiter Dunlap dead, and this prisoner standing over him with the club; and the next he hauled   the dead man into a clump of bushes and hid him, and then we stooped low, to be cut of sight, and got away.   
  But I never had the notion in my life to hurt him or harm him, spite of all them lies about my threatening him, till the very minute I raised the club―then my heart went cold!   
  Anyway, they dogged along after him all day Saturday and kept out of his sight; and towards sundown he come to the bunch of sycamores down by Uncle Silas's field, and he went in there to get a disguise out of his hand-bag and put it on before he showed himself here in the town―and mind you he done that just a little   after the time that Uncle Silas was hitting Jubiter Dunlap over the head with a club―for he DID hit him.   
  When that man there, Bruce Dunlap, had most worried the life and sense out of Uncle Silas till at last he plumb lost his mind and hit this other blatherskite, his brother, with a club, I reckon he seen his chance.   
   No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he had been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and the barbet (who knew all the gossip of the village),and   old Buldeo, the village hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys sat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the platform where a cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk every night because he was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree and talked, and pulled at the big huqas   (the water-pipes) till far into the night.   
   The distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an hour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they were skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea-Lion's Neck, past Webster House, till they came to the Salt   House just beyond the sight of the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering. He thought that he was at the world's end, but the roar of the seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel. Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch and let the drove   cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the fog-dew dripping from the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each with an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions or were too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their   heavy boots made of the skin of a walrus's throat, and then Kerick said: "Let go!" and then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.   
   "Well! May I be ――skinned!" said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a little boy. Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just then; he had seen enough of it; so he called out: "Is n't there any place for seals to go where   men don't ever come?"   
  "I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.   
  He had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals at his club.   
  The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards.   
  And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face.   
  I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair.   
  Come to the club with Basil and myself.   
  And now you had better dress and drive down to the club.   
  I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of The Globe that I picked up at the club.   
  It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at eight-fifteen.   
  It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where he found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.   
  The famous Medmenham monks, or "Hell Fire club," as they were commonly called, and of whom the notorious Wilkes was a member, were a fraternity whose motto was "Do as you please," and that invitation still stands over the ruined doorway of the abbey.   
  I believe this is the longest uninterrupted stretch anywhere above Teddington, and the Oxford club make use of it for their trial eights.   
  One man had driven his spear into the victim's heart, and to make assurance double sure, the other had dashed out his brains with a great club.   
  Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?   
  It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September (many years ago) five or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions.   
  He passed in review of the places he might go to.    "club? a game of bezique, champagne with Ignatov?    No, I'm not going.   
  The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured fat man, an ardent collector of engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, came into the drawing room before going to his club.   
  Vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength, which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish, and do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it; and for his great strength of character, which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers, commanding both fear and respect, and also at   cards, when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk, always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the English club.   
  Very soon Marya Philimonovna had established her club, so to say, under the acacias, and there it was, in this club, consisting of the bailiff's wife, the village elder, and the counting-house clerk, that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away, and in a week's time everything actually had come round.   
  It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he knew, coming from the club.   
  The doctor brought by Levin, and found by him at the club, was not the one who had been attending Nikolay Levin, as the patient was dissatisfied with him.   
  The conversation began about the row Tushkevitch and Veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevitch began describing the last boat-races in Petersburg at the Yacht club.   
  He did not care for cards; he did not go to a club.   
  " I know you are dining at the club; papa put down your name.   
  After driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good spirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club.   
  Levin reached the club just at the right time.   
  Levin had not been at the club for a very long while―not since he lived in Moscow, when he was leaving the university and going into society.   
  He remembered the club, the external details of its arrangement, but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days.   
  But as soon as, driving into the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he mounted the steps, and the hall-porter, adorned with a crossway scarf, noiselessly opened the door to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the porter's room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less trouble to take them off downstairs;as   soon as he heard the mysterious ringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy, carpeted staircase, and saw the statue on the landing, and the third porter at the top doors, a familiar figure grown older, in the club livery, opening the door without haste or delay, and scanning the visitors as they passed in―Levin felt the old impression of the   club come back in a rush, an impression of repose, comfort, and propriety.   
  A nasty, greasy fish soup was prepared, various pates chauds and fricasses (Golushkin, as a man of the highest European culture, kept a French cook, who had formerly been dismissed from a club for dirtiness) and, most important of all, several bottles of champagne had been procured and put into ice.   
  You should have seen him at our club when he sat down to cards.   
  He was a member of the club, lost at cards majestically, and was everywhere treated with respect, though many people regarded him only as a" learned man.   
  He cried out at the club that more troops were needed, that they ought to be telegraphed for from another province; he rushed off to the governor to protest that he had no hand in it, begged him not to allow his name on account of old associations to be brought into it, and offered to write about his protest to the proper quarter   in Petersburg.   
  One of the most respected of our club members, on our committee of management, Pyotr Pavlovitch Gaganov, an elderly man of high rank in the service, had formed the innocent habit of declaring vehemently on all sorts of occasions: "No, you can't lead me by the nose!"   
  But one day at the club, when he brought out this phrase in connection with some heated discussion in the midst of a little group of members (all persons of some consequence) Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, who was standing on one side, alone and unnoticed, suddenly went up to Pyotr Pavlovitch, took him unexpectedly and firmly with two fingers by the nose, and succeeded in leading   him two or three steps across the room.   
  We began by promptly and unanimously striking young Stavrogin's name off the list of club members. Then it was decided to send an appeal in the name of the whole club to the governor, begging him at once (without waiting for the case to be formally tried in court) to use "the administrative power entrusted to him" to restrain this dangerous ruffian, "this duelling   bully from the capital, and so protect the tranquillity of all the gentry of our town from injurious encroachments.   
  I will add also that, four years later, in reply to a discreet question from me about the incident at the club, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch answered, frowning: "I wasn't quite well at the time".   
  The morning after the incident at the club she cautiously but firmly approached the subject with her son, but the poor woman was trembling all over in spite of her firmness.   
  He guessed that Liputin's invitation now was the consequence of the previous day's scandal, and that as a local liberal he was delighted at the scandal, genuinely believing that that was the proper way to treat stewards at the club, and that it was very well done.   
  Our dear, mild, Ivan Ossipovitch had only just returned and only just had time to hear the angry complaint from the club.   
  Check! ' and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club.   
  If only I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.»   
  I wouldn't do it for anything….    Are you dining at the club to-morrow? '    'Yes.'   
  ' Then he remembered the last night he had played with Vasilyev at the club (just after leaving her), and he recalled his humiliating requests for another game and the other's cold refusal.   
  "Perhaps these people know some of my acquaintances," he thought; and the club, his tailor, cards, society… came back to his mind.   
  On account of all these amusements, the artillery officers, our comrades, and a few infantry men liked to gather of an evening around our battery, and the place came to be called the club.   
  Frequently, as I looked at her when, smiling, rosy with the winter air, and happy in the consciousness of her beauty, she came in from a round of calls and, taking off her hat, went to look at herself in a mirror; or when, rustling in her rich, decollete ball dress, and at once shy and proud before the servants, she was passing to   her carriage; or when, at one of our small receptions at home, she was sitting dressed in a high silken dress finished with some sort of fine lace about her soft neck, and flashing her unvarying, but lovely, smile around her―as I looked at her at such times I could not help wondering what would have been said by persons who had been   ravished to behold her thus if they could have seen her as I often saw her, namely, when, waiting in the lonely midnight hours for her husband to return from his club, she would walk like a shadow from room to room, with her hair dishevelled and her form clad in a sort of dressing-jacket.   
  Likewise, he played cards a great deal that winter, and lost considerable sums towards the end of it, wherefore, unwilling, as usual, to let his gambling affairs intrude upon his family life, he began to preserve complete secrecy concerning his play; yet Avdotia, though often ailing, as well as, towards the end of the winter, enceinte, considered herself bound always to sit up (in   a grey blouse, and with her hair dishevelled) for my father when, at, say, four or five o'clock in the morning, he returned home from the club ashamed, depleted in pocket, and weary.   
  She would ask him absent-mindedly whether he had been fortunate in play, and listen with indulgent attention, little nods of her head, and a faint smile upon her face as he told her of his doings at the club and begged her, for about the hundredth time, never to sit up for him again.   
  No one in the world could persuade her that it was REALLY from his club, and not from a mistress's, that Papa came home so late.   
  Occasionally, he would come and sit with us in the evening before going to the club. He used to sit down to the piano and bid us group ourselves around him, after which he would beat time with his thin boots (he detested heels, and never wore them), and make us sing gipsy songs.   
  And since a spectacle of that kind is to the Russian muzhik what a newspaper or a club-meeting is to the German, the vehicles soon became the centre of a crowd, and the village denuded even of its old women and children.   
  " Well, "said Grandmamma with a sad expression on her face," I do not mind telling you, as my most intimate friend, that all this seems to me a mere pretext on his part for living alone, for strolling about from club to club, for attending dinner-parties, and for resorting to―well, who knows what? She suspects nothing; you know her angelic sweetness and her   implicit trust of him in everything.   
  To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.   
  An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.   
  What club but the whaleman's can head off like that?   
  But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule -pointing at it with the marlingspike ― that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once.   
   
  If a Cossack stole the smallest trifle, it was considered a disgrace to the whole Cossack community, he was bound to the pillar of shame, and a club was laid beside him, with which each passer-by was bound to deal him a blow until in this manner he was beaten to death.   
  For this dishonourable act they bound him to a post in the bazaar, and laid a club beside him, in order that every one who passed should, according to the measure of his strength, deal him a blow.   
  But there was not one Zaporozhetz out of them all to be found who would raise the club against him, remembering his former services.   
  A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron ― a chair ― any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man.   
  I have seen our own ladies in provincial society; and on one occasion, sir, about twenty years ago, I was even in the Nobles' club at Moscow -but was there a woman to be compared with her.   
  THE saloon of the restaurant was converted into the assembly room of a Nobles' club.   
  A long placard made its appearance on the door of the restaurant, informing the most respected public that the above-mentioned marvellous conjurer, acrobat, chemist, and optician would have the honour to give a magnificent performance on the present day at eight o'clock in the evening, in the saloon of the Nobles' club (in other words, the restaurant); tickets – two rubles and a half each   .   
  'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you? ' said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh? '   
  She Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver's shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand.   
  'It's the worst of having to do with women, ' said the Jew, replacing his club; 'but they're clever, and we can't get on, in our line, without 'em.   
  He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it.   
  Charles Dickens    THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK club    CHAPTER I   
  The first ray of light which illumines the gloom, and converts into a dazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved, is derived from the perusal of the following entry in the Transactions of the Pickwick club, which the editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before   his readers, as a proof of the careful attention, indefatigable assiduity, and nice discrimination, with which his search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been conducted.   
  'That, with the view just mentioned, this Association has taken into its serious consideration a proposal, emanating from the aforesaid, Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., and three other Pickwickians hereinafter named, for forming a new branch of United Pickwickians, under the title of The Corresponding Society of the Pickwick club.   
  'That the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick club is therefore hereby constituted; and that Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., Tracy Tupman, Esq., M.P.C., Augustus Snodgrass, Esq., M.P.C., and Nathaniel Winkle, Esq., M.P.C., are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same; and that they be requested to forward, from time to time, authenticated accounts of   their journeys and investigations, of their observations of character and manners, and of the whole of their adventures, together with all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may give rise, to the Pickwick club, stationed in London.   
  And how much more interesting did the spectacle become, when, starting into full life and animation, as a simultaneous call for 'Pickwick' burst from his followers, that illustrious man slowly mounted into the Windsor chair, on which he had been previously seated, and addressed the club himself had founded.   
  Mr. Pickwick's oration upon this occasion, together with the debate thereon, is entered on the Transactions of the club.   
  He wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of that club should be allowed to continue.   
  He had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in the other a baton of crab-tree, so thick and heavy, that it might well be termed a club.
