  Introduction    Operating Environment of the bank    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
  To the shareholders of Commercial bank “Russky Slaviansky bank” (closed joint-stock company):   
  Management of the bank is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   
  In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the bank as of 31 December 2010, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.   
  Mandatory cash balances with the Central bank of the Russian Federation   
  Net increase in mandatory cash balances with the Central bank of the Russian Federation   
  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") for the year ended 31 December 2010 for Commercial bank “Russky Slaviansky bank” (closed joint-stock company) (the “bank”).   
  The bank was incorporated and is domiciled in the Russian Federation.   
  The bank is a joint stock company limited by shares and was set up in accordance with Russian legislation.   
  As at 31 December 2010 the bank's shareholder Abdulkerimov Abduzhelil Makhmudovich through a group of companies and related parties controls 51% of the bank's voting shares (31 December 2009: the ultimate controlling owners of the bank are individuals belonging to the bank's management and Board of Directors).   
  Cost assessment in roubles and US dollars is based on the Central bank average annual rate.   
  12 residential areas located on the right bank of the Mzymta in the zone of construction of the combined road Adler-Alpika Service were transferred from the reserve and specially protected zones to the recreation zone.   
  The building sites are situated straight on the bank line or process it on the total range of 11, 2 km, within National Park or on distance less than 1 km from its borders.   
  Russian Railways today seem to prefer the modernization through the tariff policies rather than through effective work or even bank loans.   
  The company has already announced a tender for selecting a bank that will provide a credit line for 3 years with annual full repayment of the loan.   
  The National bank of Ukraine (NBU) has approved the amendments to the instruction regulating banking activities in Ukraine, which change the banks' regulatory capital estimation procedure.   
  According to the document, when estimating the regulatory capital of the bank, the total amount of tier 1 and tier 2 capital will be reduced by the book value of securities being not traded on stock exchanges and by the book value of securities on non-diversified investment funds.   
  At the same time, the decree envisages that the regulative capital of the banks will be reduced by the book value of non-listed securities held in the trade portfolio of the bank, except for securities issued by principal executive authorities, NBU and by the State Mortgage Institution.   
  To compete against those who buy land for non-agricultural purposes, lease payments from farm enterprises and peasant farmers should at least be equal to the bank interest rate on the market value of a land share, i.e., on average 1, 000 rubles/ha.   
  Suspiciously, Opus Dei's elevation occurred the same year the wealthy sect allegedly had transferred almost one billion dollars into the Vatican's Institute for Religious Works ― commonly known as the Vatican bank ― bailing it out of an embarrassing bankruptcy.   
  Robbed a store.    Used a bank card in desperation.    Whatever mistake they committed, they quickly made their whereabouts known to local authorities.   
  Beneath the cross were the words: DEPOSITORY bank OF ZURICH   
  Sophie and Langdon were holding the key to a Swiss bank deposit box.   
  The secretariat nodded." Large-denomination bearer bonds drawn on the Vatican bank.   
  The cardinals exchanged uneasy looks, and finally one said," Yes, but these bonds are traceable directly to the Vatican bank. "   
  That was precisely the reason the Teacher suggested Aringarosa get the money in Vatican bank bonds.   
  The Depository bank of Zurich was a twenty-four-hour Geldschrank bank offering the full modern array of anonymous services in the tradition of the Swiss numbered account.   
  Maintaining offices in Zurich, Kuala Lumpur, New York, and Paris, the bank had expanded its services in recent years to offer anonymous computer source code escrow services and faceless digitized backup.   
  As Sophie pulled the taxi to a stop in front of their destination, Langdon gazed out at the building's uncompromising architecture and sensed the Depository bank of Zurich was a firm with little sense of humor.   
  I grabbed the overflowing plastic bag and ran, pulling my ID card out again to swipe against the security turnstiles that would allow me to enter the Elias-Clark elevator bank.   
  We didn't share anything with them, not even an elevator bank, but it didn't stop their rich bankers and our fashion beauties from checking each other out in the lobby.   
  “Hey, don't feel too bad,” he called after me as I headed toward the elevator bank. “I've been here since last Thursday morning.”   
  Only the first bank really mattered since most of the big names were on the first seventeen floors; they advertised their presence with illuminated panels over the elevator doors.   
  The urine-soaked man who slept outside the Chase bank got a daily Mocha Frappuccino.   
  By the time I made it to the lobby, Pedro, the heavily accented Mexican delivery boy from Mangia, was chatting in Spanish with Eduardo near the elevator bank.   
  “Well, I have copies of your paychecks — which, by the way, really suck… and I've got both our bank statements and printouts of our credit histories and your employment letter.   
  I'll get the cash from the basement bank, change a few grand into euros, buy a few more grand's worth of traveler's checks, and triple confirm all of her hair and makeup appointments while she's there.   
  I mean, if I was a drug dealer or a bank robber, my debt would be cleared and you people would leave me alone.   
  Filling the entire two drawers of a small desk in the living room, a desk Bosch had not searched the night before, were files, photographs and financial records, including several thick bank envelopes containing canceled checks.   
  The three siblings looked at one another without much hope. Mr. Poe was the Vice President of Orphan Affairs at Mulctuary Money Management, a large bank in the city, and part of his job was overseeing the Baudelaires' affairs after the fire. Mr. Poe was not a wicked person, but he had mistakenly placed them in the company of so much wickedness that he   had been almost as wicked as an actual wicked person, and the children were not particularly eager to contact him again, even if it was all they could think of.   
  "Mr. Poe," he said, "would you be willing to loan us some money from the bank?"   
  The wheelchair was like none Langdon had ever seen ― equipped with a bank of electronics including a multiline phone, a paging system, computer screen, even a small, detachable video camera.   
   In another country, a young guard sat patiently before an expansive bank of video monitors. He watched as images flashed before him ― live feeds from hundreds of wireless video cameras that surveyed the sprawling complex. The images went by in an endless procession.   
   Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front of him. Huge portions of the complex were open to the public, and wireless cameras had gone missing before, usually stolen by visiting pranksters looking for souvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, the signal was lost, and the screen went blank.Perplexed   , the technician gazed up at the monitor. A crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86.   
   The security technician held his breath as his commander leaned over his shoulder, studying the bank of security monitors before them.   
   The Office of the Pope seemed more of a ballroom than an office. Red marble floors sprawled out in all directions to walls adorned with vivid frescoes. A colossal chandelier hung overhead, beyond which a bank of arched windows offered a stunning panorama of the sun-drenched St. Peter's Square.   
   "How young ARE you? The Vatican is a fortress because the Catholic Church holds half of its equity INSIDE its walls ― rare paintings, sculpture, devalued jewels, priceless books… then there is the gold bullion and the real estate deeds inside the Vatican bank vaults. Inside estimates put the raw value of Vatican City at 48.5 billion dollars. Quite a nest egg you're sitting   on. Tomorrow it will be ash. Liquidated assets as it were. You will be bankrupt. Not even men of cloth can work for nothing."   
   "Play into their hands?" Olivetti said. "Believe me, removing all protection from Vatican City in order to stake out hundreds of churches is what the Illuminati HOPE we will do… wasting precious time and manpower when we should be searching… or worse yet, leaving the Vatican bank totally unprotected. Not to mention the remaining cardinals."   
  They meet in bank boardrooms, eating clubs, private golf courses.   
   Langdon strode to a large yellow button on the side of the vault. He pressed it, and a bank of overhead lights hummed on inside. The lights were deep red, turning the cube into a glowing crimson cell… a maze of towering shelves.   
   Langdon read the title. ATTIVI VATICANI. Vatican assets? He scanned the list of contents. Real estate… currency… Vatican bank… antiquities… The list went on.   
  Five minutes later she was standing at one of the payphones on the corner opposite the Commonwealth bank, dialling a number she knew only too well.   
  The plane fares and a night in a Brisbane motel would take every cent she had in her bank account.   
  He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.   
  Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts.    Wizards' bank.    Have a sausage, they're not bad cold…an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birrthday cake, neither».   
  With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank.   
  My mother rang up at 8.30 in the morning last August bank Holiday and forced me to promise to go.   
   'Is there anything you'd like for Christmas? ' I said desperately, blinking in the dazzling bank Holiday sunlight.   
   Also worried about how to celebrate birthday. Size of flat and bank balance prohibits actual party. Maybe dinner party? But then would have to spend birthday slaving and would hate all guests on arrival. Could all go out for meal but then feel guilty asking everyone to pay, selfishly presuming to force costly and dull evening on others merely to celebrate own birthday ―yet   cannot afford to pay for everyone.   
  Maybe I should ring Tom and get a lovely party together for bank Holiday Monday.   
   5: 45 p.m. Trying to concentrate hard on memorizing names of Shadow Cabinet to avoid spiral of self-doubt. Have never met Waspy's Intended of course but imagine giant thin blond rooftop giantess-type who rises at five each morning, goes to gym, rubs herself down with salt then runs international merchant bank all day without smudging mascara..   
  Don't know what to do for bank Holiday as cannot face remaining alone in London.   
   'For some reason I've been so busy I forgot to order my travelers' checks from the bank.'   
  I looked up at the top of the bank, and there was a prison truck with smoke pouring out of its engine compartment.   
  The college had just been given 30 little sloops by a grateful parent who had cleaned out the biggest savings and loan bank in California.   
  This fish, which I picked up by the gills and flung up on the bank, was an enormous pickerel.   
  I looked at the top of the bank to see what the convicts and guards thought of a fish that big.   
  While Mildred was still fairly sane, she deposited it in the Scipio branch of the First National bank of Rochester.   
  But then she withdrew it in cash when the bank was bought by the Sultan of Brunei, without telling me or Margaret that she had done so.   
  Her point was that they were heirs to the property of such robbers, and to their mode of thinking, even if they had been born poor and had only recently dismantled an essential industry, or cleaned out a savings bank, or earned big commissions by facilitating the sale of beloved American institutions or landmarks to foreigners.   
  The Dubuque meat packer who married his mother and adopted him had sold his business to the Shah of Bratpuhr shortly before he died, and had been paid in gold bricks deposited in a bank in Switzerland.   
  When I get to the bank, all the people there be jumpin up an down an cryin an slappin me on the back, an they pick me up an carry me on they shoulders to the bus.   
  Suddenly we come out on the bank of a river an ain't no place to go, an the pygmies are catchin up fast.   
  We be lookin across the river an lo an behole on the other bank they is a couple of fellers wearin bush jackets an them white pith helmets like you used to see in Ramar of the Jungle.   
  The fellers look at one another, but they paddle the canoe over to the bank.   
  Don't have to do it all your life—just a few years, then you'll have something to fall back on, money in the bank, a nest egg.”   
  Last time I looked, he had a couple of ole rowboats pulled up on the bank. Probly ain't worth a damn, but you caulk em up, they'd probly float.”   
  I done bought a bicycle with two little sidecars for Sue an Dan to ride in, an ever Sunday we peddle down to the river an set on the bank an go catfishin.   
  The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell bank looked straight through them ― which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years.   
  At Jodrell bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea.   
   Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words PLEASE DO NOT PRESS THIS BUTTON   AGAIN. He shook himself.   
   There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60, 000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand biro business.   
   He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe. When he turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he didn't turn yet, not even to react   to Arthur's yelp of surprise.   
   "At a wild guess, I'd say down here," said Zaphod, running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall.   
   They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall.   
   A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them.   
  Slowly, the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate.   
  This was a bed-sitting-room in a shabby but quiet tenement house on the Left bank," at the corner of rue St. Supplice, "says my pocket diary with grim imprecision.   
  It will be wise on your part to follow Professor Langley's example and give your wife a monthly allowance while placing a sizable" guarantee sum "in the bank which can be available to her in extreme cases and, naturally, after your demise or during an overprotracted terminal illness.   
  I also begged her, under the dripping lilacs, to accept a wad of bank notes to be used for any purpose she wished including the price of that suitcase for her trip to Sochi.   
  I became aware that I had gone out wearing morocco slippers and a torn, bleached denim trousers-and-top with, paradoxically, my passport in one nipple pocket and a wad of Swiss bank notes in the other.   
  If I could have given my definition of death to the stunned fisherman, to the mower who stopped wiping his scythe with a handful of grass, to the cyclist embracing in terror a willow sapling on one green bank and actually getting up to the top of a taller tree on the opposite side with his machine and girlfriend, to the black horses gaping   at me like people with trick dentures all through my strange skimming progress, I would have cried one word: Speed!   
  He would have gone through a bank-vault door.   
  He passed several times by the old fountain dribbling through the geranium-lined trough of a hollowed log; he examined the post office and the bank, the church and the tourist agency, and a famous black hovel that was still allowed to survive with its cabbage patch and scarecrow crucifix between a boarding-house and a laundry.   
  He recognized the fountain, and the bank, and the church, and the great chestnut tree, and the cafe.   
  "Where are we?" he looked around. "I told you the bank.   
  The banks of the creek were high enough to allow the scouts, to stand without being seen.    Billy staggered down the bank ridiculously.    After him came Weary, clanking and clinking and tinkling and hot.   
  And then he shook Billy hard, rattled his skeleton, slammed him against a bank.   
  Weary socked Billy a good one on the side of the jaw, knocked Billy away from the bank and onto the snow-covered ice of the creek.   
  The tape is locked up with his will and some other valuables in his safe-deposit box at the Ilium Merchants National bank and Trust, he says.   
  To reach it one had to drive round a large reservoir which I could make out breaking into scaly light here and there every time some adventurous hostler or pantry boy crossed it on water skis or in a Rob Roy or by means of a raft, typical raft ripples like fire snakes in Japan; and one could now follow with an artist's eye   the motorcar's lamps, fore and aft, progressing east along the AB bank of that rectangular lake, then turning sharply upon reaching its B corner, trailing away up the short side and creeping back west, in a dim and diminished aspect, to a middle point on the far margin where they swung north and disappeared.   
  While the comfortably resting lady was describing the bank of a brook where little Rockette liked to frolic, Ada sat reading on a similar bank, wistfully glancing from time to time at an inviting clump of evergreens (that had frequently sheltered our lovers) and at brown-torsoed, barefooted Van, in turned-up dungarees, who was searching for his wristwatch that he thought he had   dropped among the forget-me-nots (but which Ada, he forgot, was wearing).   
  He shaved, disposed of two blood-stained safety blades by leaving them in a massive bronze ashtray, had a structurally perfect stool, took a quick bath, briskly dressed, left his bag with the concierge, paid his bill and at six punctually squeezed himself next to blue-chinned and malodorous Johnny into the latter's Paradox, a cheap 'semi-racer.' For two or three miles they skirted   the dismal bank of the lake, coal piles, shacks, boathouses, a long strip of black pebbly mud and, in the distance, over the curving bank of autumnally misted water, the tawny fumes of tremendous factories.   
  When Van retrieved in 1940 this thin batch of five letters, each in its VPL pink silk-paper case, from the safe in his Swiss bank where they had been preserved for exactly one half of a century, he was baffled by their small number.   
  The entire staff stood in several rows on the steps of the pillared porch behind the bank President Baroness Veen and the Vice President Ida Larivière.   
  The back rows consisted of less distinguished menservants and scullions, as well as of gardeners, stableboys, coachmen, shadows of columns, maids of maids, aids, laundresses, dresses, recesses, getting less and less distinct as in those bank ads where limited little employees dimly dimidiated by more fortunate shoulders, but still asserting themselves, still smile in the process of humble dissolve.   
  The captain, the vinocherpiy, the shashlikman, and a crew of waiters had been utterly entranced by the amount of zernistaya ikra and Ai consumed by the vaporous-looking Veens and were now keeping a multiple eye on the tray that had flown back to Van with a load of gold change and bank notes.   
  Through an amiable lady in waiting at Demon's bank, Van made sure that his father would not turn up in Manhattan before March 30. They never came out or went in together, arranging a meeting place at the Library or in an emporium whence to start the day's excursions, and it so happened that the only time they broke that rule (she having got   stuck in the lift for a few panicky moments and he having blithely trotted downstairs from their common summit), they issued right into the visual field of old Mrs Arfour who happened to be passing by their front door with her tiny tan-and-gray long-silked Yorkshire terrier.   
  I remember Ada's fiancé telling me, he and young Tobak worked for a while in the same Phoenix bank.   
  She almost fell from her convex ridiculous seat as she fumbled in her shirt pocket for a stray bank note.   
  An amusing little echo, to the tune of 250 dollars, from all those concerts under the painted ceilings of a guilded past, blandly reached me in heil-hitlering Berlin, in 1936, when the Graun family entail, basically a collection of pretty snuffboxes and other precious knick- knacks, whose value after passing through many avatars in the Prussian state bank had dwindled to 43,000   reichsmarks (about 10, 000 dollars), was distributed among the provident composer's descendants, the von Korff, von Wissmann and Nabokov clans (a fourth line, the Counts Asinari di San Marzano, had died out).   
  Farther down its sinuous course, where the sand martins shot out of their holes in the steep red bank, it was deeply suffused with the reflections of great, romantic firs (the fringe of our Vyra); and still farther downstream, the endless tumultuous flow of a water mill gave the spectator (his elbows on the handrail) the sensation of receding endlessly, as if this were   the stern of time itself.   
  While crossing over, I could see the huts of a hamlet on my left, apple trees, rows of tawny pine logs lying on a green bank, and the bright patches made on the turf by the scattered clothes of peasant girls, who, stark naked in shallow water, romped and yelled, heeding me as little as if I were the discarnate carrier of my present   reminiscences.   
  The wide-windowed dining car, a vista of chaste botdes of mineral water, miter-folded napkins, and dummy chocolate bars (whose wrappers, Cailler, Kohler, and so forth, enclosed nothing but wood), would be perceived at first as a cool haven beyond a consecution of reeling blue corridors; but as the meal progressed toward its fatal last course, and more and more dreadfully one equilibrist   with a full tray would back against our table to let another equilibrist pass with another full tray, I would keep catching the car in the act of being recklessly sheathed, lurching waiters and all, in the landscape, while the landscape itself went through a complex system of motion, the daytime moon stubbornly keeping abreast of one's plate, the distant meadows opening fanwise, the   near trees sweeping up on invisible swings toward the track, a parallel rail line all at once committing suicide by anastomosis, a bank of nictitating grass rising, rising, rising, until the little witness of mixed velocities was made to disgorge his portion of omelette aux confitures de fraises.   
  During the beginning of that summer and all through the previous one, Tamara's name had kept cropping up (with the feigned naïveté so typical of Fate, when meaning business) here and there on our estate (Entry Forbidden) and on my uncle's land (Entry Strictly Forbidden) on the opposite bank of the Oredezh.   
  Like a tottering ghost, the pale ray would weave across a clay bank at the turn as I began the downhill ride toward the river.   
  We skipped school: I forget what Tamara's procedure was; mine consisted of talking either of the two chauffeurs into dropping me at this or that corner on the way to school (both were good sports and actually refused to accept my gold- handy five-rouble pieces coming from the bank in appetizing, weighty sausages of ten or twenty shining pieces, in the aesthetic recollection   of which I can freely indulge now that my proud émigré destitution is also a thing of the past).   
  In one city, a famous gangster robbed a bank of a thousand pounds and spent the whole lot on Wonka bars that same afternoon.   
  As soon as everyone was safely in, the Oompa-Loompas pushed the boat away from the bank and began to row swiftly downriver.   
  The building was a modern steel and concrete structure with a bank of smooth-running elevators, and within a matter of seconds Mason opened the door marked HUNTLEY L. BANNER―Enter.   
  I stole some money from the bank, I'd go to prison if they found out, he holds it over me, you see.   
  There was trouble about the cheque, of course. The woman wouldn't take it at first, but I got her to ring my bank and she changed her tune very quick.   
  The guy has a small account in a Hollywood bank.   
  You can't find out much about it, of course, from the bank, but I did find out that he had references from Riverside, California.   
  He had an account at one of the banks, but the bank either didn't know anything about what he did for a living or wouldn't tell.   
  Emerged with his uneasy dog and went    Along the reedy bank.    He came too late.   
  A blurry shape stepped off the reedy bank   
  That happened during a hopeless trip to Italy, in a lakeside hotel garden, roses, black araucarias, rusty, greenish hydrangeas, one cloudless evening with the mountains of the far shore swimming in a sunset haze and the lake all peach syrup regularly rippled with pale blue, and the captions of a newspaper spread flat on the foul bottom near the stone bank perfectly readable through   the shallow diaphanous filth, and because, upon hearing him out, she sank down on the lawn in an impossible posture, examining a grass culm and frowning, he had taken his words back at once; but the shock had fatally starred the mirror, and thenceforth in his dreams her image was infected with the memory of that confession as with some disease or the secret   aftereffects of a surgical operation too intimate to be mentioned.   
  He braked the globe abruptly with his thumb.    bank: India pays off.    Please collect, Madam.   
  He asked two swift questions, then, “Very well, I'll come at once.    Meanwhile, alert the blood bank and prepare for a transfusion.»    He broke the connection, then called the night porter to get a taxi for Denise.   
  Above the distant, still sadder hills there lingered, under a cloud bank, a depth of tortoise-shell sky.   
  The road, what there was of it, now ran on the Southern bank and they had to ford the River to reach it.   
  Soon they were all on the bank, dripping buthappy.   
  Then she looked to her left and saw what she took to be a great bank of brightly-coloured cloud, cut off from them by a gap. But she looked harder and saw that it was not a cloud at all but a real land.   
  Digory's hand was shaking as he opened his penknife and cut out a long strip of turf on the bank of the pool.   
  A little way off, along the river bank, willows were growing. On the other side tangles of flowering currant, lilac, wild rose, and rhododendron closed them in.   
  Throw the apple towards the river bank where the ground is soft.”   
  On the opposite bank, at least a thousand paces away (if one cold walk across water), I could make out the tiny figures of two men working like beavers on their stretch of shore.   
  Suddenly, down the sand bank behind us, from under the bushes and pines, a stone rolled, then another.   
  At this point, I should explain that the prompt appearance of the patrolmen, hardly more than a minute after the accident, was due to their having been ticketing the illegally parked cars in a cross lane two blocks down the grade; that the fellow with the glasses was Frederick Beale, Jr., driver of the Packard; that his 79-year-old father, whom the nurse had   just watered on the green bank where he lay―a banked banker so to speak―was not in a dead faint, but was comfortably and methodically recovering from a mild heart attack or its possibility; and, finally, that the laprobe on the sidewalk (where she had so often pointed out to me with disapproval the crooked green cracks) concealed the mangled remains of Charlotte   Humbert who had been knocked down and dragged several feet by the Beale car as she was hurrying across the street to drop three letters in the mailbox, at the corner of Miss Opposite's lawn.   
  Somewhere in Nebraska, on Main Street, near the First National bank, established 1889, with a view of a railway crossing in the vista of the street, and beyond that the white organ pipes of a multiple silo.   
  I promise you, Brewster, you will be happy here, with a magnificent cellar, and all the royalties from my next play―I have not much at the bank right now but I propose to borrow―you know, as the Bard said, with that cold in his head, to borrow and to borrow and to borrow.   
  The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings.   
  Then it selected a nice gravelly bit of bank which would take no footprints and came out on the Northern side.   
  When once Shasta had reached the far end of the bridge he found the crowd melting away; everyone seemed to be going either to the left or right along the river bank.   
  After that, he went down to the river bank, but not too near the bridge, and had a drink.   
  She tore herself away from her friend's affectionate embraces, stepped into a punt, cast off, and a moment later was out in midstream with a huge real moon overhead and a huge reflected moon down, deep down, in the river.    The air was fresh and cool and as she drew near the farther bank she heard the hooting of an owl.    “Ah! That's better!” thought Aravis.   
  The eastern-flowing river, which was pouring from the higher mountains at the western end of the range, was far too swift and too broken with rapids for them to think of swimming it; but after some casting about, up and down the bank, they found a place shallow enough to wade.   
  “Friends, we are in Archenland!” said Bree proudly as he splashed and churned his way out on the Northern bank.   
  Instead of a dust-cloud well out in the desert he now saw a black, moving mass, rather like ants, on the far bank of the Winding Arrow.   
   'There is a strange tale to tell! ' said Legolas. 'There are only two boats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.'   
   'The Orcs have been on this ground, ' he said. 'Otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. All our footprints are here, crossing and re-crossing. I cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for Frodo began.' He returned to the bank, close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the River. 'There are some   clear prints here, ' he said. 'A hobbit waded out into the water and back; but I cannot say how long ago.'   
   'I came across, ' said the evil voice. 'A winged Nazgûl awaits us northward on the east-bank.'   
  There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in the north bank.   
   At nightfall he brought them to his ent-house: nothing more than a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank.   
  Rowan-trees grew in a circle about it, and there was water (as in all ent-houses), a spring bubbling out from the bank.   
  Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was little sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the Ents at the Moot still rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, sometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge.   
  He came to the ashes of the watch-fire near the river-bank, and then began to retrace the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought.   
   It was not long before Aragorn found fresh signs. At one point, near the bank of the Entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too light for much to be made of them. Then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. The earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal   much.   
  Following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back through the forest, down the bank of the Entwash.   
  That is why the town was called Flower Town.    It stood on the bank of a little brook.    The Mites called it Cucumber River because so many cucumbers grew on its banks.   
  At last it headed for the river and tumbled headlong down the steep bank. Dunno fell out and lay unconscious on the river-bank. The car sank to the bottom of the river.   
  "No, there aren't. All the boys have gone to live on the river-bank. They've built their own town called 'Kite Town'."   
  "This is called Water-Melon River," said Snowdrop.    "See how many melons are growing along the bank?"    A narrow bridge that looked very much like a strip of carpet was thrown from one bank to the other.   
  A narrow bridge that looked very much like a strip of carpet was thrown from one bank to the other.   
  As you have heard, Kite Town stands on the bank of a river. No trees grow there, and so the streets are not so pretty as in Greenville. But there are almost as many flowers as in Flower Town, and the houses are very attractive.   
  Montag walked from the subway with the money in his pocket (he had visited the bank which was open all night and every night with robot tellers in attendance) and as he walked he was listening to the Seashell radio in one car.   
  Another year ticked by in a single hour, and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river.   
  They moved along the bank of the river, going south.   
  “Oh, Lor!” said the boy, sitting down on the grassy bank at the edge of the shrubbery and very quickly getting up again because the grass was soaking wet.   
  Now she was losing speed. Instead of being carried up the river she was gliding in to the river bank on her left.   
  But soon they were on the north bank of the river, flying above wooded country.   
  After a time the Queen felt sleepy, and they spread cloaks for her on the grassy bank, and Prince Rilian with the rest of the party went a little way from her, that their tales and laughter might not wake her.   
  It was a shallow, noisy stream, and even Jill was not wet above her knees when they reached the northern bank.   
  On the north side of each bank the snow already lay in deep drifts; and after each climb you came down into a drift and got wet.   
  She was looking out of a hole in a steep bank which sloped down and reached the level about fourteen feet below her.   
  But when they caught sight of Jill they all came running towards her, and as many as could scrambled up the bank, and a dozen or more hands were stretched up to help her.   
  And Jill caught hold of them and thus got out of the hole and came slithering down the bank head first, and then picked herself up and said:   
  Then Jill scrambled up the bank and put her head in at the dark opening and shouted the good news in to the prisoners.   
  Then you went into a cutting; and immediately the same shadow flicked close up to you and got big, racing: long the grass of the cutting-bank.   
  "Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up.   
  They were beginning to get very tired of it when they noticed a delicious smell, and then a flash of bright colour high above them at the top of the right bank.   
  They panted up the steep bank, forced their way through some brambles, and found themselves standing round an old tree that was heavy with large yellowishgolden apples as firm and juicy as you could wish to see.   
  He floundered away to the far bank and Peter knew that Susan's arrow had struck on his helmet.   
  He and Susan, fully dressed as they were, plunged in, and before the water was up to their shoulders their hands were on the side of the boat. In a few seconds they had hauled her to the bank and lifted the Dwarf out, and Edmund was busily engaged in cutting his bonds with the pocket knife.   
  There Trufflehunter called at the mouth of a little hole in a green bank and out popped the last thing Caspian expected—a Talking Mouse.   
  It's the Ford of Beruna again now!” cried the girls) and up the bank on the far side and into the town.   
  They swept on across the level fields on the north bank, or left bank, of the river.   
  At Beaversdam they re-crossed the river and came east again along the southern bank. They came to a little cottage where a child stood in the doorway crying.   
  " I have about a hundred and eighty bucks in the bank.   
  The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank.   
  Mr Beaver led them across the dam and on to the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the trees right down by the river-bank.   
  And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turned away from the river-bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes.   
  And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it.   
  He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being seen; and he wanted above all things to see which way the Witch's sledge went.   
  “What do you mean, Mr Beaver?” panted Peter as they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley together.   
  So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed themselves.   
  Carl Heinrich Graun died at the age of fifty-eight, in 1759, in Berlin, where seventeen years earlier, the new opera house had opened with his Caesar and Cleopatra.    He was one of the most eminent composers of his time, and even the greatest, according to local necrologists touched by his royal patron's grief.    Graun is shown (posthumously) standing somewhat aloof, with folded arms, in Menzel's picture of Frederick the Great playing Graun's composition on the flute; reproductions of this kept following me through all the German lodgings I stayed in during my years of exile.    I am told there is at the Sans-Souci Palace in Potsdam a contemporary painting representing Graun and his wife, Dorothea Rehkopp, sitting at the same clavecin.    Musical encyclopedias often reproduce the portrait in the Berlin opera house where he looks very much like the composer Nikolay Dmitrievich Nabokov, my first cousin.    An amusing little echo, to the tune of 250 dollars, from all those concerts under the painted ceilings of a guilded past, blandly reached me in heil-hitlering Berlin, in 1936, when the Graun family entail, basically a collection of pretty snuffboxes and other precious knick- knacks, whose value after passing through many avatars in the Prussian state bank had dwindled to 43,000   reichsmarks (about 10, 000 dollars), was distributed among the provident composer's descendants, the von Korff, von Wissmann and Nabokov clans (a fourth line, the Counts Asinari di San Marzano, had died out). Two Baronesses von Korff have left their trace in the police records of Paris.    One, born Anna-Christina Stegelman, daughter of a Swedish banker, was the widow of Baron Fromhold Christian von Korff, colonel in the Russian army, a great-granduncle of my grandmother.    Anna-Christina was also the cousin or the sweetheart, or both, of another soldier the famous Count Axel von Fersen; and it was she who, in Paris, in 1791, lent her passport and her brand-new custom-made traveling coach (a sumptuous affair on high red wheels, upholstered in white Utrecht velvet, with dark green curtains and all kinds of gadgets, then modern, such as a   vase de voyage) to the royal family for their escape to Varennes, the Queen impersonating her, and the King, the tutor of the two children. The other police story involves a less dramatic masquerade.    With Carnival week nearing, in Paris, more than a century ago, the Count de Morny invited to a fancy ball at his house" une noble dame que la Russie a prêtée cet hiver à la France (as reported by Henrys in the Gazette du Palais section of the Illustration, 1859, p. 251).    This was Nina, Baroness von Korff, whom I have already mentioned; the eldest of her five daughters, Maria (1842-1926), was to marry in September of the same year, 1859, Dmitri Nikolaevich Nabokov (1827-1904), a friend of the family who was also in Paris at the time.    In view of the ball, the lady ordered for Maria and Olga, flower-girl costumes, at two hundred and twenty francs each.   
  Farther down its sinuous course, where the sand martins shot out of their holes in the steep red bank, it was deeply suffused with the reflections of great, romantic firs (the fringe of our Vyra); and still farther downstream, the endless tumultuous flow of a water mill gave the spectator (his elbows on the handrail) the sensation of receding endlessly, as if this were   the stern of time itself.   
  After skirting the river for three or four miles, I found a rickety footbridge.    While crossing over, I could see the huts of a hamlet on my left, apple trees, rows of tawny pine logs lying on a green bank, and the bright patches made on the turf by the scattered clothes of peasant girls, who, stark naked in shallow water, romped and yelled, heeding me as little as if I were the discarnate carrier of my present   reminiscences.    On the other side of the river, a dense crowd of small, bright blue male butterflies that had been tippling on the rich, trampled mud and cow dung through which I trudged rose all together into the spangled air and settled again as soon as I had passed. After making my way through some pine groves and alder scrub I came to the bog   .   
  The wide-windowed dining car, a vista of chaste botdes of mineral water, miter-folded napkins, and dummy chocolate bars (whose wrappers, Cailler, Kohler, and so forth, enclosed nothing but wood), would be perceived at first as a cool haven beyond a consecution of reeling blue corridors; but as the meal progressed toward its fatal last course, and more and more dreadfully one equilibrist   with a full tray would back against our table to let another equilibrist pass with another full tray, I would keep catching the car in the act of being recklessly sheathed, lurching waiters and all, in the landscape, while the landscape itself went through a complex system of motion, the daytime moon stubbornly keeping abreast of one's plate, the distant meadows opening fanwise, the   near trees sweeping up on invisible swings toward the track, a parallel rail line all at once committing suicide by anastomosis, a bank of nictitating grass rising, rising, rising, until the little witness of mixed velocities was made to disgorge his portion of omelette aux confitures de fraises.   
  During the beginning of that summer and all through the previous one, Tamara's name had kept cropping up (with the feigned naïveté so typical of Fate, when meaning business) here and there on our estate (Entry Forbidden) and on my uncle's land (Entry Strictly Forbidden) on the opposite bank of the Oredezh.   
  Like a tottering ghost, the pale ray would weave across a clay bank at the turn as I began the downhill ride toward the river.   
  Consequently, we were forced to wander a good deal about the town (she, in her little gray-furred coat, I, white-spatted and karakul-collared, with a knuckle-duster in my velvet- lined pocket), and this permanent quest for some kind of refuge produced an odd sense of hopelessness, which, in its turn, foreshadowed other, much later and lonelier, roamings. We skipped school: I forget   what Tamara's procedure was; mine consisted of talking either of the two chauffeurs into dropping me at this or that corner on the way to school (both were good sports and actually refused to accept my gold- handy five-rouble pieces coming from the bank in appetizing, weighty sausages of ten or twenty shining pieces, in the aesthetic recollection of which I can freely   indulge now that my proud émigré destitution is also a thing of the past).   
  The stranger quietly watching the torrents of local grief from an abstract bank.   
  Doomed to walk back and forth on a bridge which has ceased to be one since neither bank is really attainable.   
  The strong compact dusky forehead had that peculiar hermetic aspect (a bank safe? a prison wall?) which the brows of thinkers possess.   
  The hawkman in the toilet lounge pointed out (between cigar and cuspidor) that the difficulty might be neatly countered by showing only her shadow, her falling shadow, falling and glancing across the edge of the turfy bank amid a shower of shadowy flowers.   
  The house fronts on one side of the street were bathed in an amber light which brought out every, oh, every, detail; some displayed mosaic designs; the principal city bank, for instance, had seraphs amid a yuccalike flora.   
  This was a cluster of rentable cottages on a hillside overlooking the river, the opposite bank of which revealed in terms of fir trees and alder bushes the heavily timbered acres of your aunt's estate.   
  On the south bank (from which he had come) he could see, further upstream, Paduk's pink palace and the bronze dome of the Cathedral, and the leafless trees of a public garden.   
  A door slammed with the kind of ill-fitting thud that comes to us from the far bank of a river where woodsmen are at work.   
  The dwelling place of the maiden whom he had long been courting without success stood on the bank of some lake or other, and there she would be every evening sitting on her balcony and doing two things at once: knitting a stocking and enjoying the view.   
  He passed the barbers' and two dentists' and came out between a warehouse and the customs onto the river bank.   
  The river went heavily by towards the sea between the banana plantations: the General Obregon was tied up to the bank, and beer was being unloaded— a hundred cases were already stacked upon the quay.   
  He had said the boat would not go before morning, but you could never trust those people not to keep to time-table, and sure enough, when he came out onto the bank between the customs and the warehouse, the General Obregon was already ten feet off in the sluggish river, making for the sea.   
  One oil-lamp was lit in the bows, and the girl whom MR Tench had spotted from the bank began to sing gently—a melancholy, sentimental, and contented song about a rose which had been stained with true love's blood.   
  He glanced along the wall to the picture of James Calver, wanted in the United States for bank robbery and homicide: a tough uneven face taken at two angles: description circulated to every station in Central America: the low forehead and the fanatic bent-on-one-thing eyes.   
  James Calver, bank robber and homicide, stared in harsh profile towards the first communion party.   
  The banana plantations came down on either bank: his voice boomed under the hard sun: that and the churr of the motor were the only sounds anywhere— he was completely alone.   
  He walked up to his bungalow: it was distinguished from the others which lay along the bank by a tiled roof, a flagpost without a flag, a plate on the door with the title, «Central American Banana Company».   
  The swamp and vultures and no children anywhere, except a few in the village, with bellies swollen by worms, who ate dirt from the bank, inhumanly.   
  —But the mule took its time, sliding down the bank towards the river.   
  The young man, who was studying the country, took his glasses from the pocket of his faded, khaki flannel shirt, wiped the lenses with a handkerchief, screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he saw the wooden bench beside the door; the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular saw was   , and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream.   
  The girl leaned back against the heather on the bank of the stream and Robert Jordan stretched himself out, his shoulders against the ground and his head against a clump of the heather.   
  - The town is built on the high bank above the river and there is a square there with a fountain and there are benches and there are big trees that give a shade for the benches.   
  Pilar was climbing the bank into the timber carrying three rifles.   
  As he looked away the three were on the edge of the road and Fernando was shaking his head as they tried to get him up the bank.   
  He held both hands against his groin now and put his head back against the bank, his legs straight out before him.   
  " Then we will be down for thee, "Primitivo said and started up the slope after the gypsy, who was climbing fast.    Fernando lay back against the bank.    In front of him was one of the whitewashed stones that marked the edge of the road.   
  Then he looked at Fernando lying there against the bank with his hands cupped over the groove of his hip, his lips blue, his eyes tight shut, breathing heavily and slowly, and he thought, If I die may it be quickly.   
  Fernando was still lying against the bank and he was still breathing.   
  See, man?    This side of where the bank steepens.    "Leave me," said Pilar.   
  However, he did manage to come up, and, puffing and snorting, his eyes rounded in terror, Ivan Nikolaevich began swimming through the black, oil-smelling water among the broken zigzags of street lights on the bank.   
  Schizophrenia, as was Said It was half past one in the morning when a man with a pointed beard and wearing a white coat came out to the examining room of the famous psychiatric clinic, built recently on the outskirts of Moscow by the bank of the river.   
  Beyond the grille a balcony came into view, beyond that the bank of a meandering river, and on its other bank a cheerful pine wood.   
  Beyond the window grille, in the noonday sun, the joyful and springtime pine wood stood beautiful on the other bank and, closer by, the river sparkled.   
  The woods on the opposite bank of the river, sdll lit up by the May sun an hour earlier, turned dull, smeary, and dissolved.   
  In the gallery a bewildered citizen found in his pocket a bank-wrapped packet with 'One thousand roubles' written on it.   
  'Money, ' the artiste went on, 'must be kept in the state bank, in special dry and well-guarded rooms, and by no means in some aunt's cellar, where it may, in particular, suffer damage from rats!   
  He did not rejoice in the spring flooding of the Dnieper, when, overflowing the islands by the lower bank, the water merged with the horizon.   
  ''He won't get to realize the gold pieces, ' the same voice mixed in, turning the barman's heart to ice. 'On Andrei Fokich's demise, the house will immediately be torn down, and the gold will be sent to the State bank.   
  Margarita held in her hands an old brown leather album which contained a photographic portrait of the master, a bank savings book with a deposit of ten thousand roubles in his name, the petals of a dried rose pressed between sheets of tissue paper, and part of a full-sized notebook covered with typescript and with a charred bottom edge.   
   If a bank or a finance company owned the land, the owner man said, The bank- or the Company- needs- wants- insists- must have- as though the bank or the Company were a monster, with thought and feeling, which had ensnared them.   
   Yes, he can do that until his crops fail one day and he has to borrow money from the bank.   
   But- you see, a bank or a company can't do that, because those creatures don't breathe air, don't eat side-meat.   
   We can't depend on it. The bank- the monster has to have profits all the time. It can't wait. It'll die. No, taxes go on. When the monster stops growing, it dies. It can't stay one size.   
  The bank owned the land then, but we stayed and we got a little bit of what we raised.   
   We know that- all that.    It's not us, it's the bank.    A bank isn't like a man.   
  It's not us, it's the bank.    A bank isn't like a man.    Or an owner with fifty thousand acres, he isn't like a man either.   
  It's the monster.    The bank isn't like a man.     Yes, but the bank is only made of men.   
  The bank isn't like a man.     Yes, but the bank is only made of men.     No, you're wrong there- quite wrong there.   
   No, you're wrong there- quite wrong there.    The bank is something else than men.    It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it.   
  He had learned from other sources that the mother had checked on him, with results that could only have pleased her, not the least of which was a well-kept bank account.   
  Does not Sebastian himself refer somewhere to the "pink candlesticks of great chestnut trees" along the bank of some beautiful little river? '   
  One was the common one with writers of his type: the bridging of the abyss lying between expression and thought; the maddening feeling that the right words, the only words are awaiting you on the opposite bank in the misty distance, and the shudderings of the still unclothed thought clamouring for them on this side of the abyss.   
  The lights go out, the curtain rises and a Russian summer landscape is disclosed; the bend of a river half in the shade because of the dark fir trees growing on one steep clay bank and almost reaching out with their deep black reflections to the other side which is low and sunny and sweet, with marsh-flowers and silver-tufted grass.   
  Names, dates, and even faces have been hewn in the red clay of the steeper bank and swifts dart in and out of holes therein.   
  Then the nude bather emerges on the opposite bank, blowing his nose with the aid of his thumb; it is the long-haired village priest.   
  And taken all in all was it, this echo of a distant past (and echoes are seldom more than a bark, no matter how pure-voiced the caller), was it worth the ruin of our home and the grief of my mother?    The duel was fought in a snow-storm on the bank of a frozen brook.    Two shots were exchanged before my father fell face downwards on a blue-grey army cloak spread on the snow.   
  The office was quite near.    The bank was farther. Did anybody of my numerous friends live near the station?    No, they all lived in Passy or around the Porte St Cloud, the two Russian quarters of Paris.   
   A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green.   
   On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them.   
   Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all, and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his back.   
   George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank.   
  An' I got fifty more saved up right in the bank, right now.   
   But we gonna do it now, and don't you make no mistake about that. George ain't got the money in town. That money's in the bank. Me an' Lennie an' George. We gonna have a room to ourself. We're gonna have a dog an' rabbits an' chickens. We're gonna have green corn an' maybe a cow or a goat. "   
   When he was finished, he sat down on the bank, with his side to the pool, so that he could watch the trail's entrance.   
   George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes.   
   But George sat stiffly on the bank and looked at his right hand that had thrown the gun away. The group burst into the clearing, and Curley was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand.   
   They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved; nor the next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more to eat than they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their   bags, even with what they had got from the trolls. One morning they forded a river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery.   
   "Ss, ss, ss," said Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was forgetting this sort of thing. But just as Bilbo was beginning to hope that the wretch would not be able to answer, Gollum brought up memories of ages and ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a river,"Sss   , sss, my preciouss," he said. "Sun on the daisies it means, it does."   
   But suddenly Gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago, and sitting under the river bank teaching his grandmother, teaching his grandmother to suck―"Eggses!" he hissed. "Eggses it is!" Then he asked:   
   Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these things. He had a feeling that the answer was quite different and that he ought to know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get   frightened, and that is bad for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat. He flapped into the water and paddled to the bank; Bilbo could see his eyes coming towards him. His tongue seemed to stick in his mouth; he wanted to shout out: "Give me more time! Give me time!" But all that came out with a sudden squeal 
  He nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small mountain-stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries that he found on its bank, but it was not much good.   
   "I have been picking out bear-tracks," he said at last. "There must have been a regular bears' meeting outside here last night. I soon saw that Beorn could not have made them all: there were far too many of them, and they were of various sizes too. I should say there were little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears,all   dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came from almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In that direction only one set of footprints led ― none coming, only ones going away from here. I followed these as far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into the river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the   rock for me to cross.     It is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I had to walk miles before I found a place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back again to pick up   the tracks again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far.     They went straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the night before last.   
   They were thirsty too, for they had none too much water, and in all the time they had seen neither spring nor stream. This was their state when one day they found their path blocked by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not very wide right across the way, and it was black, or looked it in the gloom. It was   well that Beorn had warned them against it, or they would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, and filled some of their emptied skins at its bank. As it was they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water. There had been a bridge of wood across, but it had rotted and fallen leaving only the broken posts   near the bank.   
   Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: "There is a boat against the far bank!   
   "I don't believe it is tied," said Bilbo, "though of course I can't be sure in this light; but it looks to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank, which is low just there where the path goes down into the water."   
  By the window (outside which there was a similar multi-office building, with repairs going on so high in the sky that it seemed as though they might as well do something about the ragged rent in the gray cloud bank) stood a bowl with an orange and a half and an appetizing jar of yogurt, and in the bookcase, in its locked bottom   compartment, forbidden cigars and a large blue-and-red heart were preserved.   
  Among the emigration one will hardly scrape up a dozen people capable of appreciating the fire and fascination of this fabulously witty composition; and I would maintain that in today's Russia you could not find even one to appreciate it, if I had not happened to know of the existence of two such people, one living on the north bank of the Neva and   the other, somewhere in distant Siberian exile."   
  The sun changefully illuminated the opposite bank, and when with the onset of a cloud the very air seemed to close, like a great blue eye and then slowly open again, one shore always lagged behind the other in the process of gradually fading and lighting up.   
  At the spot where a wide sandy declivity reached the water, with the uncovered roots of apprehensive pines supporting the sliding bank, there were some more people, and down below on a strip of grass lay three naked corpses, white, pink and brown, like a triple sample of the sun's action.   
  The badly pressed shadow of the car sped madly along the grassy bank, where flowers blended into coloured streaks.   
  But surely the General would hold the Yankees on the opposite bank of the river.   
  She sank down on the low bank, and stripping off the remnants of her slippers and stockings, dabbled her burning feet in the cool water.   
  But reluctantly she replaced her shoes and stockings and trudged down the bank, spongy with moss, under the shady trees.   
  And, as I seem to be making a clean breast of it, I must tell you, in strictest confidence (that means, don't tell Miss Pittypat!) that I did have the money, safe in a bank in Liverpool.   
  She would not put the money in the bank, for it might fail or the Yankees might confiscate it.   
  He's got a Yankee friend in New York who wrote him about workin' in a bank up there.   
  An old friend who made the Grand Tour with me before the war has offered me a position in his father's bank.   
  And if he liked a person―and he seemed to like so many people! ―he sold them lumber on credit without ever thinking to find out if they had money in the bank or property.   
  To make matters worse, he and Mammy had patiently searched the house while she was ill and unearthed her hidden store of money. And Frank had deposited it in the bank in his own name, so now she could not even hire a rig.   
  You'll want me to bank you, at some incredibly low interest, so you can buy more mills and more mules and build more saloons.   
  When I need money I'll borrow it from the bank, thank you, she said coldly, but her breast was heaving with rage.   
  I own plenty of stock in the bank.   
  Rhett now had a desk in the bank.   
  More about that river, about its steep bank, about its old bathhouse. This was a wooden structure standing on piles; a stepped path, with a toad on every other step, led down to it, and not everyone could have found the beginning of that clayey descent in the alder thicket at the back of the church.   
  Leaving behind the misty mass of the fortress he began to slide down a steep, dewy bank of turf, reached a pale path between cliffs, twice, three times crossed the bends of the main road, which, having finally shaken off the last shadow of the fortress, ran more straight and free, and a filigrane bridge across a dried-up rivulet brought Cincinnatus to the city   .   
  Beyond the city everything shimmered dimly, merged, and dissolved; but, above the invisible Gardens, in the rosy depths of the sky, stood a chain of translucent and fiery cloudlets, and there stretched a long violet bank with burning rents along its lower edge, and while Cincinnatus gazed, yonder, yonder an oak-covered hill flashed with Venetian Green and slowly sank into shadow.   
  'Tried to sleep, could not, only got chilled all through, and now it is dawn "(Cincinnatus wrote rapidly, illegibly, leaving words unfinished, as a running man leaves an incomplete footprint)," now the air is pale, and 1 am to frozen that it seems to me that the abstract concept of 'cold' must have as its concrete form the shape of my body, and they   are going to come for me any time now It makes me ashamed to be afraid, but I am desperately afraid, fear, never halting, rushes through me with an ominous roar, like a torrent, and my body vibrates like a bridge over a waterfall, and one has to speak very loud to hear oneself above the roar, I am ashamed; my soul has disgraced   itself, for this ought not to be, ne dolzhno bïlo bï bït' ― only on the bark of the Russian language could such a fungus bunch of verbs have sprouted, oh how ashamed I am that my attention is occupied, my soul blocked by such dithering details, they push through, with lips wet, to say farewell, all lands of memories come to say farewell: I   , a child, am fitting with a book in the hot sun on the bank of a dinning stream, and the water throws its wavering reflection on the lines of an old, old poem,, love at the sloping of our years'-but I know I should not yield, 'Becomes more tender and superstitious',   
  The game was in full swing.    Zalivanov, flushed with excitement, was keeping the bank.    Just then footsteps sounded on the stairs. Looking around, Pavel saw Prokhoshka coming down, and he slipped under the staircase to let the man pass into the kitchen. It was dark there under the stairs and Prokhoshka could not see him.   
  A girl in a white sailor blouse with a striped blue collar and a short light-grey skirt stood on the bank, holding on to the willow and bending low over the water. Short socks with a coloured edging clung to her shapely suntanned legs. Her chestnut hair was gathered in a heavy braid.   
  He realised what had happened and without turning around, hissed at the girl sitting above him on the bank: "Can't you keep quiet?   
  Up on the bank Tonya was doubled up with laughter. "Bravo, bravo!" she cried, clapping her hands. "Well done!"   
  Seizing his entangled fishing line, Pavel jerked at it so hard that it snapped, and scrambled up the bank to the road.   
  With the terrible fury of despair, the smith fought fiercely for two lives, and for a long time the dry crackle of rifle fire could be heard from the river bank where the brigands now rushed, sensing the danger.   
  The tall right bank drops steeply down to the water, like a mountain halted in its advance by the broad sweep of the waters. The flat left bank below is covered with sandy spots left when the water receded after the spring floods.   
  Five men lay beside a snub-nosed Maxim gun in a tiny trench dug into the river bank.   
  The day before, worn out by the endless battles and swept back by a hurricane of Polish artillery fire, they had given up Kiev, withdrawn to the left bank of the river, and dug in there.   
  The Poles, having driven the Red units out of Darnitsa, now occupied a small bridgehead on the left bank of the river beside the railway bridge.   
  The frontier posts march across the snowbound fields, push through clearings cut in forests, plunge down valleys and, heaving themselves up hillsides, disappear behind the crests only to pause on the high bank of a river to survey the wintry plains of an alien land.   
  To the right, by the river bank, were the low meadows, and to the left a rye field rose and dipped all the way to the horizon. The wind rippled the ears of the ripe grain. Poppies sprinkled the roadside with bright red. It was quiet here, and unbearably hot. But from the distance, where the silvery ribbon of the river basked in the   sun, came the cries of battle.   
  All the inhabitants were waiting at the frontier bridge on the bank of the stream.   
  The young folk were lined up on either side of the road. The roofs of cottages and sheds on the Polish side were covered with people who were watching the proceedings on the opposite bank with tense interest. There were crowds of peasants on the cottage steps and by the garden fences. When the procession entered the human corridor the band struck up the   Internationale. Later stirring speeches were delivered from a platform decorated with greenery. Young men and white-headed veterans addressed the crowd.   
  Then Grishutka Khorovodko spoke. Gavrilov, listening to his wrathful speech, turned his horse around and scanned the opposite bank to see whether anyone there was taking notes. But the river bank was deserted. Even the sentry by the bridge had been removed.   
  In the daytime, while his brother worked, Anton sat in a friendly pub or sprawled among the dandelions on the cool, still vividly green grass along the canal bank and observed with envy exuberant roughs loading coals on a barge, or else stared stupidly at the empty blue of the sleep-inducing sky.   
  They sprawled on the bank and pelted one another with clammy velvety sand. They slapped her on her wet bathing pants as soon as she lay down flat.   
  On the east side of the highway the map shows a vast space all dotted over: it is the forest; there, in its very heart, lies the small lake we bathed in, with, on its western bank, spread fanwise tike playing cards, a dozen allotments, only one of which is sold (Ardalion's ― if you can call it sold).   
  'Yes, I'm coming your way, ' said I in answer to his question,    i've got to visit my bank.'    'Dog's weather, ' said Orlovius floundering at my side.   
  At the very first bend it headed inexorably for die bank, the convex parasol showed in profile and Martin recognized Rose.   
  Beyond Lyon, the southern night gradually spread overhead; the pale rectangles of the reflected coach windows sped along the black bank; in the dirty, insufferably stuffy second-class compartment, Martin's only companion was a middle-aged Frenchman.   
  "What lights?" the man asked glancing at the window, but at this moment everything was shut out by the sudden rise of a dark bank.   
  Once, in the downstairs hall, I happened to hold the door for him, and his mispronounced German "thank you" (danke) rhymed exactly with the locative case of the Russian word for "bank", where, by the way, he worked.   
  Close to the bank I saw deep pools, the water blue like the sky.   
  The road here was below the level of the river bank and all along the side of the sunken road there were holes dug in the bank with infantry in them.   
  The sun was going down and looking up along the bank as we drove I saw the Austrian observation balloons above the hills on the other side dark against the sunset.   
  Here at the brickyard we were sheltered from rifle or machine-gun fire by the river bank.   
  Outside we ran across the brickyard.    A shell burst short near the river bank.    Then there was one that we did not hear coming until the sudden rush.   
  Mr.Cunningham at the bank does it.   
  But those Meyers and the man from the bank with his wife and daughters. "He cashes my sight drafts," I said.   
  We went on up the bank looking for a place to cross.   
  Along the river bank there was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground.   
  We went up to the bank and finally we saw the railway bridge.   
  Not knowing what to do with himself he wandered down the footpath by the river, and from the opposite bank came ecstatic squeals and glimpses of naked bodies.   
  He walked along the bank, trying to find another bridge, the bridge where you sink up to your ankles in sawdust.   
  But on the other bank everything was unfamiliar, lights flashed past and shadows slid by.   
   And then, just as Pooh was beginning to think that he must have chosen the wrong stone or the wrong river or the wrong day for his Idea, something grey showed for a moment by the river bank… and it got slowly bigger and bigger… and at last it was Eeyore coming, out.   
   "What was?" asked Eeyore.     "Hooshing you to the bank like that."     "HOOSHING me?" said Eeyore in surprise. "Hooshing ME? You didn't think I was HOOSHED, did you? I dived. Pooh dropped a large stone on me, and so as not to be struck heavily on the chest, I dived and swam to the bank."   
   "HOOSHING me?" said Eeyore in surprise. "Hooshing ME? You didn't think I was HOOSHED, did you? I dived. Pooh dropped a large stone on me, and so as not to be struck heavily on the chest, I dived and swam to the bank."   
  If you're standing on the slippery bank of a river, and somebody BOUNCES you loudly from behind, you slip.   
  And once we've got things going, the State bank and the Commercial bank will give us loans. So that's my little plan. It is going to be discussed at the executive committee meeting on Friday, and if they agree, the rest is up to you. "   
  It brings to mind Pushkin's poem: "There he stood, full of great thoughts, on the bank…."   
  The first-class saloon had been fitted up for an exhibition of bank notes and bonds.   
  The lottery ship was watched malevolently from the bank by the smooth operator.   
  The ship shuddered; cymbals clashed together, flutes, cornets, trombones and tubas thundered out a wonderful march, and the town, swinging around and trying to balance, shifted to the left bank.   
  The actors, who had now freed themselves from the chains of Sestrin's constructivism, acted with spirit, danced energetically, and sang in tuneful voices.    The river-bank audience was thoroughly satisfied.    Next came the balalaika virtuoso.   
  Next came the balalaika virtuoso.    The river bank broke into smiles.    ―   
  Polkan approached the side and glared at the bank.   
  Polkan, however, having run his piggy eyes along the bank, immediately turned around, ambled to the committee chairman, stood him against a white wall, pushed a book into his hand, and, asking him not to move, smoothly turned the handle of his cine-camera for some minutes.   
  Ippolit Matveyevich took a fiat wooden box into his quivering hands. Ostap continued to grope inside the chair in the darkness. A beacon flashed on the bank; a golden pencil spread across the river and swam after the ship.   
  Now, when a dozen similar ties of a smoky, luminous shade say that of a sunset cloud appeared in a haberdasher's window, together with a dozen handkerchiefs in exactly the same tints, Anton Petrovich would buy both the fashionable tie and fashionable handkerchief, and every morning, on his way to the bank, would have the pleasure of encountering the same tie and the same   handkerchief, worn by two or three gentlemen who were also hurrying to their offices.   
  Only yesterday he had been a perfectly honorable man, respected by friends, acquaintances, and fellow workers at the bank.   
  Far below, ice blocks sparkled near a hole cut in the smooth expanse of white and, on the opposite bank, very straight columns of pink smoke stood above the snowy roofs of log cabins.   
  The letters were from the States.    One was a bank statement.    It showed a balance of $2432.60.   
  No matter what café in Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde.   
  We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame.   
  On the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and loosened a chunk of sod.   
  We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields.   
  They're plenty up above, too."    Bill went down the bank.    "Take a worm can."   
  It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank.   
   Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily, wondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank was a large hole.   
   Kanga was jumping along the bank, saying "Are you SURE you're all right, Roo dear?" to which Roo, from whatever pool he was in at the moment, was answering "Look at me swimming!"   
  The river now reflected the terra cotta of the left-hand bank, overgrown at the top with fir and racemosa. Names and dates had been cut in the red steep, and in one place ten years ago someone had carved a huge face with prominent cheekbones.   
  The right bank sloped gently, with purple patches of heather between dappled birch trees.   
  Even if you began forging bank notes, that wouldn't change anything.   
  Entangled with these others, Clyde and they spun across forty feet of smooth, green ice and piled against a snow bank.   
  They were the people who, having moved the Cranston Wickwire Company from Albany, and the Finchley Electric Sweeper from Buffalo, and built large factories on the south bank of the Mohawk River, to say nothing of new and grandiose houses in Wykeagy Avenue and summer cottages at Greenwood, some twenty miles northwest, were setting a rather showy, and hence disagreeable, pace to all of   the wealthy residents of this region.   
  On the third Sunday afternoon in July, Clyde, as lonely and rebellious as ever, was paddling about in a dark blue canoe along the south bank of the lake about a mile and a half from the boathouse. His coat and hat were off, and in a seeking and half resentful mood he was imagining vain things in regard to the type of life   he would really like to lead.   
  And on the bank to the left was a girl standing and looking at them.   
  Then maneuvering the canoe next to the bank, which was a foot above the water, and laying hold of a root to hold it still, he said: “Of course you won't be in any danger.   
  “And to think I turned in here and there you were on the bank, looking at those water lilies.   
  Oh, how it would feel to have him talk to her — say again as he did in the boat that he never had seen any one look so pretty as she did standing on the bank and looking for water lilies.   
  “You see, it's this way,” she explained to Clyde when, a few evenings later, she had managed to steal out for an hour and they walked from the region at the end of Taylor Street down to the Mohawk, where were some open fields and a low bank rising above the pleasant river.   
  Summer days perhaps, and that soon, in which he and she would be in a canoe at Twelfth Lake, the long shadows of the trees on the bank lengthening over the silvery water, the wind rippling the surface while he paddled and she idled and tortured him with hints of the future; a certain forest path, grass-sodden and sun-mottled to the south   and west of the Cranston and Phant estates, near theirs, through which they might canter in June and July to a wonderful view known as Inspiration Point some seven miles west; the country fair at Sharon, at which, in a gypsy costume, the essence of romance itself, she would superintend a booth, or, in her smartest riding habit, give an exhibition of her horsemanship   — teas, dances in the afternoon and in the moonlight at which, languishing in his arms, their eyes would speak.   
  And yet (stepping up on the near-by bank and shaking the water from his clothes) had he?   
  And Mason concluding that possibly he was about somewhere and unaware of anything, of course, deciding to wait a few minutes anyhow — while advising Swenk to fall back into the woods and if by any chance encountering Slack or any other to advise him that one man be sent east along the bank and another west, while he — Swenk — proceeded in a boat eastward   as before to the inn at the extreme end, in order that from there word might be given to all as to the presence of the suspect in this region.   
  In consequence, and without any knowledge of the local political situation, he proceeded to the office of Ira Kellogg, president of the Cataraqui County National bank, who, although Catchuman did not know it, was high in the councils of the Democratic organization.   
  One Italian, sentenced for the murder of a bank watchman, became hysterical, screamed, dashed the chair and table of his cell against the bars of his door, tore the sheets of his bed to shreds and even sought to strangle himself before eventually he was overpowered and removed to a cell in a different part of the building to be observed as to his   sanity.   
  “Street preachers,” observed a passing bank clerk to his cashier girl friend.   
  All over the sloping bank lay supine or prone bodies with every possible shade of suntan; some still had a pinkish rash on their shoulder blades, others glowed like copper or were the color of strong coffee with cream.   
  The sun tried to slip in between them, but they would sweep over it with their blinding edge; the air grew dim, then the sun ripened again, but it was the opposite bank that would be illumined first, we remained in the even, colorless shade, while over there the warm light had already spread itself. The shadows of the pines revived on the sand   ; small naked figures flared up, modeled out of sunlight; and, all of a sudden, like an enormous happy oculus, the radiance opened to engulf our side as well.   
  It was just that everybody was terribly envious of Lyonya, and Father simply believed that if someone was involved in financial operations without actually buying or selling anything, he belonged either behind the bars of a bank or behind the bars of a jail.   
  They hadn't a car at Robin Hill since the War, of course, and he had only driven once, and landed up a bank, so she oughtn't to mind his trying.   
  He had from there a view of the river bank, and stood with his eyes fixed on it, oblivious of the fact that it would be an hour at least before her figure showed there.   
  From the bank, awhile, in the warm summer stillness, she watched the water-lily plants and willow leaves, the fishes rising; sniffed the scent of grass and meadow-sweet, wondering how she could force everybody to be happy.   
  In the field beyond the bank where her skiff lay up, a machine drawn by a grey horse was turning an early field of hay.   
  When the storm was over, he left his retreat and went down the wet path to the river bank.   
  One who was a sculptor, a Slav, a sometime resident in New York, an egoist, and impecunious, was to be found of an evening in June Forsyte's studio on the bank of the Thames at Chiswick.   
  She went down to the river bank, and stood gazing at a moonstreak on the darkening water.   
  It is such a bore about Jack; now we shan't get away till after bank Holiday.   
  He went back to the window, and suddenly saw her coming down to the bank.   
  She was one of those generously built, fine-faced, dark-haired Frenchwomen, whose every action and tone of voice inspire perfect confidence in the thoroughness of their domestic tastes, their knowledge of cooking, and the careful increase of their bank balances.   
  He had not seen her again, but every quarter he had signed her cheque, forwarding it to her bank, with a note to the Chelsea flat to say that he had done so; and always he had received a note in acknowledgment, generally from the flat, but sometimes from Italy; so that her personality had become embodied in slightly scented grey paper, an upright   fine handwriting, and the words, ‘Dear Cousin Jolyon.'   
  “Young Pariser was there, James; you remember—he nearly broke the bank at Monte Carlo afterwards.”   
  But she was loyal and liberal; her small eager hand was ever against the oppressions of academic and commercial opinion, and though her income was considerable, her bank balance was often a minus quantity.   
  The models— ‘Very new, modom; quite the latest thing—' which those two reluctantly turned down, would have filled a museum; the models which they were obliged to have nearly emptied James' bank.   
  Below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank, stretched to the fernery, and, beyond that refinement, became fields, dropping to the pond, the coppice, and the prospect―'Fine, remarkable'―at which Swithin Forsyte, from under this very tree, had stared five years ago when he drove down with Irene to look at the house.   
  At the foot of the bank, on a carriage rug, Holly and the dog Balthasar teased and loved each other, and in the shade old Jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar luxuriously savoured, gazed at Irene sitting in the swing.   
  He had never, till those last few weeks, had this curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in the stream of life, and with the other half left on the bank, watching that helpless progress.   
  He would sketch now and then, but only fragments―a small roof-top, with smoke curling from a chimney and birds flying; a bit of water with a willow bending over it and perhaps a boat anchored; a mill pond with ducks afloat, and a boy or woman on the bank.   
  He had already put aside sixty dollars in a savings bank since he had given Angela the ring and he decided to treble it as quickly as possible and then start.   
  He had saved some eight hundred dollars, which was in a savings bank and he withdrew three hundred for his little outing.   
  Thus he stood by the bank of this still lake, studying the water, marvelling at the subtleties of reflected radiance, feeling the artist's joy in perfect natural beauty, twining and intertwining it all with love, death, failure, fame.   
  Meanwhile, Eugene, with thirteen hundred added to the thousand and some odd dollars he had left in his bank from previous earnings, was convinced that his career was made, and decided, as he had planned to go to Paris, for the summer at least.   
  He had since used three hundred dollars of his remaining capital of twelve hundred, but M. Charles' sale of two pictures at four hundred each had swelled his bank balance to seventeen hundred dollars; however, on this he had to live now until additional pictures were disposed of.   
  His son Henry, Sylvia's husband, had become a treasurer of the local bank. He was working as patiently and quietly as ever, going to church Sundays, going to Chicago occasionally on business, consulting with farmers and business men about small loans.   
  When his work was done at night he would hurry home, following the right bank of the little stream until he reached a path which led up to the street whereon was the Hibberdell house.   
  The difference between this idyllic stream bank and his shop and all who were of it, struck him forcefully.   
  He still had ninety-seven of the hundred dollars he had brought with him, he told her, and this was going in the bank.   
  He notified Colfax that he was going to take a few days rest, went to the bank where he had over four thousand dollars on deposit, and drew it all.   
  M. Charles had suggested to a great bank director that his new bank in the financial district be decorated by Eugene alone, which was eventually done―nine great panels in which he expressed deeply some of his feeling for life.   
  We have not got hands enough. "    And from the bank someone bawled in reply:" Where IS he? "    " In the tavern. That is where you must go and look for him. "   
  " Do you call THAT sort of thing work? "    At this juncture there came from somewhere on the bank a seemingly exultant shout of:" Ah! NOW it's giving way! "    And almost at the same moment, there stole over the river a sort of rustle, a sort of quiet crunching which made the projecting pine branches quiver as though they were trying to catch at something, while, shouldering their mattocks, the barefooted sailors noisily hastened aboard their barges with the aid of rope ladders.   
  " Put the tools together, "Ossip shouted.    " And look alive there, and make for the bank. "    " Aye, and a fine Easter Day it will be for us on THAT bank! "growled Sashok.   
  " And look alive there, and make for the bank. "    " Aye, and a fine Easter Day it will be for us on THAT bank! "growled Sashok.    Meanwhile, it was the river rather than the town that seemed to be motionless―the latter had begun, as it were, to quiver and reel, and, with the hill above it, to appear to be gliding slowly up stream, even as the grey, sandy bank some ten sazheni from us was beginning to grow tremulous, and to recede.   
  Meanwhile, it was the river rather than the town that seemed to be motionless―the latter had begun, as it were, to quiver and reel, and, with the hill above it, to appear to be gliding slowly up stream, even as the grey, sandy bank some ten sazheni from us was beginning to grow tremulous, and to recede.   
  This caused a keen sense of danger to strike home in my heart, and to make my feet feel as though already the ice was escaping their tread. So, automatically picking themselves up, those feet started to bear my body in the direction of a spot on the sandy bank where the winter-stripped branches of a willow tree were writhing, and whither there   were betaking themselves also Boev, the old soldier, Budirin, and the brothers Diatlov.   
  " It will have, for this year at least, to be kept without you. "    Seating himself on the sand, the old soldier lit his pipe and growled:" What cowards you all are! The bank was only fifteen sazheni from us, yet you ran as though possessed! "    " With you yourself as leader, "put in Mokei.   
  Upon which all crowded together, and Boev, thrusting the tools into a hole in the bank, groaned: "The order 'go' has been given, so go we MUST, well though a man in receipt of such an order might ask himself, 'How is it going to be done? '"   
  Ha! Here is Old Father Sun coming out to greet us."    Readily did the men bare their tousled grey or flaxen heads as momentarily the sun glanced through a bank of thin white vapour before again concealing himself, as though averse to arousing any false hopes.    "Now!" sharply commanded Ossip in his new-found voice.   
  Yes, come, mates!"    With which, stuffing his cap into his bosom, and grasping the spirit-level in his hands, Ossip set foot upon the ice with a sliding, cautious, shuffling gait. At the same moment, there came from the bank behind us a startled cry of:    "Where are you off to, you fools?"   
  " Wow! "said Toto again, and Dorothy saw he was looking along the bank of the river.   
  A quarter of a mile along the bank stood a small, round house, painted bright red, and as it was on their side of the river they hurried toward it.   
  I know a man who lives on the opposite bank, for I've seen him there a good many years; but we've never spoken because neither of us has ever crossed over. "   
  They began to recognize the scenes they had passed, and by and by they came in sight of the little house of the Quadlings again.    The man was standing on the river bank and he called to them:    " How do you do?   
  So they sat still and waited and, even while they were wondering what could be done, the raft slowed down, stopped, and began drifting the other way — in the direction it had first followed.    After a time they repassed the Quadling house and the man was still standing on the bank.    He cried out to them:   
  While they waited here, Ojo spied a long broken branch lying upon the bank, so he leaped ashore and got it.   
  Floating around a bend they saw ahead a high bank of water, extending across the entire river, and toward this they were being irresistibly carried.   
  Swiftly the raft climbed the bank of water and slid down on the other side, plunging its edge deep into the water and drenching them all with spray.   
  It obeyed very well, for the current was more sluggish now, and soon they had reached the bank and landed safely.   
  Between some grey spikes on a wall I can just discern the boisterous current of the Kura, with sakli 
  With Virubov, I had been sitting on a bench near the wicket-gate of his hut, as intermittently he had screwed his lecherous eyes in the direction of the stout, ox-eyed lacemaker, Madame Ezhov, who, after disposing of her form on a bank hard-by, had fallen to picking lice out of the curls of her eight-year-old Petka Koshkodav.   
  Cowperwood's father was a bank clerk at the time of Frank's birth, but ten years later, when the boy was already beginning to turn a very sensible, vigorous eye on the world, Mr Henry Worthington Cowperwood, because of the death of the bank's president and the consequent moving ahead of the other officers, fell heir to the place vacated by the promoted teller,at   the, to him, munificent salary of thirty-five hundred dollars a year.   
  He was sure that Andrew Jackson was all wrong in his opposition to Nicholas Biddle and the United States bank, one of the great issues of the day.   
  He was worried, as he might well be, by the perfect storm of wildcat money which was floating about and which was constantly coming to his bank — discounted, of course, and handed out again to anxious borrowers at a profit.   
  His bank was the Third National of Philadelphia, located in that center of all Philadelphia and indeed, at that time, of practically all national finance — Third Street — and its owners conducted a brokerage business as a side line.   
  There was a fish-market not so very far from his home, and there, on his way to see his father at the bank, or conducting his brothers on after-school expeditions, he liked to look at a certain tank in front of one store where were kept odd specimens of sea-life brought in by the Delaware Bay fishermen.   
  He already knew a number of the more prosperous merchants who dealt with his bank, and because as a clerk his duties necessitated his calling at other banking-houses, he had come to be familiar with and favorably known in the bank of the United States, the Drexels, the Edwards, and others.   
  He was quite often allowed to come to the bank on Saturdays, when he would watch with great interest the deft exchange of bills at the brokerage end of the business.   
  His father, pleased at his interest, was glad to explain so that even at this early age — from ten to fifteen — the boy gained a wide knowledge of the condition of the country financially — what a State bank was and what a national one; what brokers did; what stocks were, and why they fluctuated in value.   
  Steemberger, so his father said, was close to Nicholas Biddle, Lardner, and others of the United States bank, or at least friendly with them, and seemed to be able to obtain from that organization nearly all that he asked for.   
  He used to come to the brokerage end of the elder Cowperwood's bank, with as much as one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollars, in twelve months — post-notes of the United States bank in denominations of one thousand, five thousand, and ten thousand dollars.   
   Tying to the bank above, where lay a score of other anxious boats, Kit and his companions went ahead on foot to investigate.   
  It was only a matter of two minutes, in which time they rode the ridge three-quarters of a mile, and emerged in safety and tied to the bank in the eddy below.   
   Several miles below they ran in to the bank, and all four walked down to look at the bad water. The river, which was a succession of rapids, was here deflected toward the right bank by a rocky reef.   
   then those on the bank saw its nose take the whirlpool as it slipped off the Mane. The steersman, vainly opposing with his full weight on the steering-gear, surrendered to the whirlpool and helped the boat to take the circle.   
  Two managed to make the bank in the eddy below.   
   Several minutes later, half-swamped and lying against the bank in the eddy below the White Horse, Shorty spat out a mouthful of tobacco juice and shook Kit's hand.   
   At the top of the bank they met Breck. His wife stood at a little distance. Kit shook his hand.   
   Barely had they shoved Breck's boat out from the bank and caught the first rough water, when the waves began to lap aboard.   
   They emerged, breathless, wet through, and filled with water almost to the gunwale. Lighter pieces of baggage and outfit were floating inside the boat. A few careful strokes on Shorty's part worked the boat into the draw of the eddy, and the eddy did the rest till the boat softly touched against the bank.   
  At daylight they found the Yukon, half a mile wide, running white from ice-rimmed bank to ice-rimmed bank.   
   He goes to the central window, through which, with his back to the company, he contemplates the river and the flowers in Battersea Park on the opposite bank as if they were a frozen desert.   
   When Freddy paid a visit to Earlscourt (which he never did when he could possibly help it) to make the desolating announcement that he and his Eliza were thinking of blackening the Largelady scutcheon by opening a shop     he found the little household already convulsed by a prior announcement from Clara that she also was going to work in an old furniture shop in Dover Street, which had been started by a fellow Wellsian. This appointment Clara owed, after all, to her old social accomplishment of Push. She had made up her mind that, cost what it might, she would see Mr   Wells in the flesh; and she had achieved her end at a garden party. She had better luck than so rash an enterprise deserved. Mr Wells came up to her expectations. Age had not withered him, nor could custom stale his infinite variety in half an hour. His pleasant neatness and compactness, his small hands and feet, his teeming ready brain, his unaffected accessibility   , and a certain fine apprehensiveness which stamped him as susceptible from his topmost hair to his tipmost toe, proved irresistible. Clara talked of nothing else for weeks and weeks afterwards. And as she happened to talk to the lady of the furniture shop, and that lady also desired above all things to know Mr Wells and sell pretty things to him,she offered Clara   a job on the chance of achieving that end through her.     And so it came about that Eliza's luck held, and the expected opposition to the flower shop melted away. The shop is in the arcade of a railway station not very far from the Victoria and Albert Museum; and if you live in that neighborhood you may go there any day and buy a buttonhole from Eliza.     Now here is a last opportunity for romance. Would you not like to be assured that the shop was an immense success, thanks to Eliza's charms and her early business experience in Covent Garden? Alas! the truth is the truth: the shop did not pay for a long time, simply because Eliza and her Freddy did not know how to keep it. True,Eliza   had not to begin at the very beginning: she knew the names and prices of the cheaper flowers; and her elation was unbounded when she found that Freddy, like all youths educated at cheap, pretentious, and thoroughly inefficient schools, knew a little Latin. It was very little, but enough to make him appear to her a Porson or Bentley, and to put him at   his ease with botanical nomenclature. Unfortunately he knew nothing else; and Eliza, though she could count money up to eighteen shillings or so, and had acquired a certain familiarity with the language of Milton from her struggles to qualify herself for winning Higgins's bet, could not write out a bill without utterly disgracing the establishment. Freddy's power of stating in Latin that Balbus built   a wall and that Gaul was divided into three parts did not carry with it the slightest knowledge of accounts or business: Colonel Pickering had to explain to him what a cheque book and a bank account meant. And the pair were by no means easily teachable. Freddy backed up Eliza in her obstinate refusal to believe that they could save money by engaging   a bookkeeper with some knowledge of the business. How, they argued, could you possibly save money by going to extra expense when you already could not make both ends meet? But the Colonel, after making the ends meet over and over again, at last gently insisted; and Eliza, humbled to the dust by having to beg from him so often, and stung by the   uproarious derision of Higgins, to whom the notion of Freddy succeeding at anything was a joke that never palled, grasped the fact that business, like phonetics, has to be learned.     On the piteous spectacle of the pair spending their evenings in shorthand schools and polytechnic classes, learning bookkeeping and typewriting with incipient junior clerks, male and female, from the elementary schools, let me not dwell. There were even classes at the London School of Economics, and a humble personal appeal to the director of that institution to recommend a course bearing on the flower   business. He, being a humorist, explained to them the method of the celebrated Dickensian essay on Chinese Metaphysics by the gentleman who read an article on China and an article on Metaphysics and combined the information. He suggested that they should combine the London School with Kew Gardens. Eliza, to whom the procedure of the Dickensian gentleman seemed perfectly correct (as in fact it   was) and not in the least funny (which was only her ignorance), took the advice with entire gravity. But the effort that cost her the deepest humiliation was a request to Higgins, whose pet artistic fancy, next to Milton's verse, was calligraphy, and who himself wrote a most beautiful Italian hand, that he would teach her to write. He declared that she was congenitally   incapable of forming a single letter worthy of the least of Milton's words; but she persisted; and again he suddenly threw himself into the task of teaching her with a combination of stormy intensity, concentrated patience, and occasional bursts of interesting disquisition on the beauty and nobility, the august mission and destiny, of human handwriting. Eliza ended by acquiring an extremely uncommercial script which   was a positive extension of her personal beauty, and spending three times as much on stationery as anyone else because certain qualities and shapes of paper became indispensable to her. She could not even address an envelope in the usual way because it made the margins all wrong.     Their commercial schooldays were a period of disgrace and despair for the young couple. They seemed to be learning nothing about flower shops. At last they gave it up as hopeless, and shook the dust of the shorthand schools, and the polytechnics, and the London School of Economics from their feet for ever. Besides, the business was in some mysterious way beginning to take   care of itself. They had somehow forgotten their objections to employing other people. They came to the conclusion that their own way was the best, and that they had really a remarkable talent for business.     The Colonel, who had been compelled for some years to keep a sufficient sum on current account at his bankers to make up their deficits, found that the provision was unnecessary: the young people were prospering.   
  Over my head hung chestnut trees decked with gold; at my feet lay a mass of chestnut leaves which resembled the amputated palms of human hands; on the opposite bank, where there waved, tanglewise, the stripped branches of a hornbeam, an orange-tinted woodpecker was darting to and fro, as though caught in the mesh of foliage, and, in company with a troupe of   nimble titmice and blue tree-creepers (visitors from the far-distant North), tapping the bark of the stem with a black beak, and hunting for insects.   
  Still, "he added, with a dispassionate charity," he has his faults; which of us hasn't?    He doesn't dig this bank quite regularly.    There, for instance, "and he stamped suddenly on one spot.   
  Then he looked gravely round the garden, and saw the loose figure of Atkinson standing and jingling the half-sovereign in his pocket, and beyond, in the purple twilight, the figure of the Indian sitting bolt upright upon a bank of grass with his face turned towards the setting sun.   
  They all three (for the doctor had joined them) turned involuntarily towards the dim grassy bank amid the tossing trees purple with twilight, where they had last seen the brown man swaying in his strange prayers.   
  At daybreak next morning he was thunderstruck to see that this stray handful of English, entirely unsupported from their rear, had flung themselves across the river, half by a bridge to the right, and the other half by a ford higher up, and were massed upon the marshy bank below him.   
  The narrowest of its narrow sides overhung the steep green bank of a railway, and was shaken by passing trains.   
  The man in black on the green bank was Sir Aaron Armstrong's man-servant Magnus.   
  So soon as an inquirer or two had stepped off the line and across the smoky hedge, they saw, rolled down almost to the bottom of the bank, the body of an old man in a yellow dressing-gown with a very vivid scarlet lining.   
  They walked some way in silence along the windy grassy bank by the rail, and just as they came under the far-flung shadow of the tall Armstrong house, Father Brown said suddenly, like a man throwing away a troublesome thought rather than offering it seriously: "Of course, drink is neither good nor bad in itself.   
  Merton's official superior, a grizzled and capable detective named Gilder, was standing on the green bank waiting for the coroner, talking to Patrick Royce, whose big shoulders and bristly beard and hair towered above him.   
  He was broken against this green bank we are standing on».   
  Vague shapes swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.   
  He dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw it among a bank of brambles.   
  And so, running, man and dogs dipped over the bank and down to the frozen bed of the Yukon, and in the gray light were gone.   
  Not having found a likely spot, they held on for the opposite bank a mile away.   
  At last Daylight glimpsed what he was looking for, a dead tree close by the bank.   
  They warmed their hands for the last time, pulled on their mittens, and mushed the dogs over the bank and down to the river-trail.   
  Then the near bank loomed for a moment and was gone, loomed a second time and remained.   
  In a few minutes the far bank, a mile away, unobtrusively came into view, and ahead and behind, the whole frozen river could be seen, with off to the left a wide-extending range of sharp-cut, snow-covered mountains.   
  As it was, he tied on his snowshoes, left the dogs curled in the snow and Kama breathing heavily under his rabbit skins, and climbed up to the big flat above the high earth-bank.   
  It was ten at night when they pulled up the earth-bank and flew along the main street of Circle City; and the young Indian, though it was his spell to ride, leaped off and ran behind the sled.   
  No signs of other men did they see, though once they passed a rude poling-boat, cached on a platform by the river bank.   
  And down by the river bank a clump of dwarf willows burst into bud.   
  His little tin safe is as good as the time-locker in the First National bank of Laredo as far as you and me are concerned. "   
  He knew the extent of his credit as well as the Chemical National bank knows the amount of H20 that collateral will show on analysis.   
  One afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a bank, and received another proof of the enormous distance that separated Ruth from him.   
  He had never been inside a bank in his life, and he had an idea that such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very powerful.   
  His father had been a bank cashier, but he lingered for years, dying of consumption in Arizona, so that when he was dead, MrButler, Charles Butler he was called, found himself alone in the world.   
  To the water or you are lost!" cried their unseen friend, and without hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon the broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in her arms.   
  They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strange plant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream the Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim.   
  See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the cloud-bank.   
  He had also a check-book on the Woolwich branch of the Capital and Counties bank, through this his identity was established.   
  By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to   be told at last to the insatiable sea.   
  As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the bank opposite, just above the water's edge, caught his eye, and dreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijo riverside residence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust.   
  The boat struck the bank full tilt.   
  The bank is so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether: O no, it isn't what it used to be, at all.   
  The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket.   
  A broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank, and the Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat.   
  The Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Mole's arm; then he did the same by the other side of him and, swimming behind, propelled the helpless animal to shore, hauled him out, and set him down on the bank, a squashy, pulpy lump of misery.   
  The Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song.   
  So the Rat went away, and sat on the river bank in the sun, and made up a song about them, which he called   
  You surely don't mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just live in a hole in a bank, and BOAT?   
  You travel the streets, and a finger beckons to you, a handkerchief is dropped for you, a brick is dropped upon you, the elevator cable or your bank breaks, a table d'hote or your wife disagrees with you, and Fate tosses you about like cork crumbs in wine opened by an un-feed waiter.   
  " Mr. Smith was an art-ist, as well as an in-vent-or, and he paint-ed a pic-ture of a riv-er which was so nat-ur-al that, as he was reach-ing a-cross it to paint some flow-ers on the op-po-site bank, he fell in-to the wa-ter and was drowned.   
  It has a past and a future, like a deposit paid into a bank; and it is something that can be argued about.   
  The bright hot morning had changed slowly to a grey, oppressive afternoon; a heavy bank of clouds, with the yellow tinge of coming thunder, had risen in the south, and was creeping up.   
  It appears that he was very hard up, we found several pawn tickets at his rooms, his account at the bank is overdrawn, and there's this case in to-day's papers;” his cold blue eyes travelled from one to another of the three Forsytes in the carriage.   
  When the man reached the bank Tip asked:" Will you row us to the other side "?   
  So successful was the trip that presently they were climbing, wet and dripping, up the grassy bank.   
  The horse obeyed, and although their progress was slow they finally reached the opposite river bank at a place where it was low enough to enable the creature to scramble upon dry land.   
  Then he brought it to the top of the bank, carefully wiped the water from its pumpkin face with his handkerchief, and ran with it to Jack and replaced the head upon the man's neck ".   
  One man had been sentenced to hard labour for having convicted his superiors of a theft; another for having struck an official who had unjustly confiscated the property of a peasant; a third because he forged bank notes.   
  No matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.   
  Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Yea and Salt Water.   
  Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit.   
  And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly,   
  But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the Barracks, loaded with letters for the outside.   
  This had been strong upon him when he pulled into the bank, and it had not departed from him.   
  A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river.   
  And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.   
  Hans and Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from tree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore.   
  Buck, on the bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off his master.   
  Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds.   
   As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank, on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea.   
   So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.   
  Crouching among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us.   
   There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes's elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and exultant   , his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight.   
   "There is but one place where he can have fled," she answered. "There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where he would fly."     The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window.    Holmes held the lamp towards it.   
  It began at the very forest, and flowed in and out among the scattered tree-clumps on the flat, and spilled over and down to the river bank where the long canoes were lined up ten and twelve deep.   
  Some one called warningly from the opposite bank, whereat they stood still and conferred together.   
  A tow-rope was requisitioned from an up-coming boat, and a pair of horses from a pack-train on the bank, and the ghastly jetsam hauled ashore.   
  But she shook her head and waited till he reached the farther bank; for she felt the call, not only upon her own pride, but upon the pride of her race; and it was a greater demand than her demand, just as the race was greater than she.   
  Cordwood, six dollars per cord, and piled on the bank where steamers can make a landing.   
  "Curious, ain't it?" Dave hazarded suggestively, as they crossed the main street to the river bank.   
  There was a jangling of gongs as McGregor saluted him from the pilot-house and the Laura slipped out from the bank.   
  The waiting group received them with open arms, helping them up the bank and carrying their shell after them.   
  They could see the struggle plainly from the bank, ―four men standing up and poling a way through the jarring cakes.   
  A few more strokes and it grounded at the foot of the bank.   
  So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them.   
  So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge.   
  Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting.   
   ' "We were passing to the north of the Hector bank that voyage.   
   No fun in it. Always alligator. One of them flopped into the river and all but capsized the canoe. But this excitement was over directly. Then in a long empty reach he was very grateful to a troop of monkeys who came right down on the bank and made an insulting hullabaloo on his passage. Such was the way in which he was approaching   greatness as genuine as any man ever achieved. Principally, he longed for sunset; and meantime his three paddlers were preparing to put into execution their plan of delivering him up to the Rajah.   
  The first thing he knew was his canoe coming to the bank.   
  He made efforts, tremendous sobbing, gasping efforts, efforts that seemed to burst his eyeballs in their sockets and make him blind, and culminating into one mighty supreme effort in the darkness to crack the earth asunder, to throw it off his limbs ― and he felt himself creeping feebly up the bank.   
   'The river-bank was steep; a great freshness ascended, the light fell on the edge of smooth dark water frothing without a ripple; right and left the shapes of the houses ran together below the sharp outlines of the roofs.   
  The very thought of the world outside is enough to give me a fright; because, don't you see," he continued, with downcast eyes watching the action of his boot busied in squashing thoroughly a tiny bit of dried mud (we were strolling on the river-bank) ― "because I have not forgotten why I came here.   
  It was that night on the river-bank, after he had killed the man ― after she had flung the torch in the water because he was looking at her so.   
  The conflagration made a clear zone of fire for the rifles of the small party, and expired smouldering on the edge of the forests and along the muddy bank of the creek.   
  To prevent a rush being made into the town the construction of a stockade was to be commenced at daylight at the end of the street on the left bank.   
   Perhaps one of the inhabitants, who had fled to the other bank of the river, coming back for some object of domestic use.   
  As the train turned east at Spuyten Duyvil and followed the east bank of the Harlem River, Hurstwood nervously called her attention to the fact that they were on the edge of the city.   
  Then she found she must put her money in the bank for safety, and so moving, finally reached the place where it struck her that the door to life's perfect enjoyment was not open.   
  She could look about on her gowns and carriage, her furniture and bank account.   
  1. That Smelkoff had drawn from the bank, some time before his death, three thousand eight hundred rubles; that, after a due and careful inventory of the money of the deceased, only three hundred and twelve rubles and sixteen kopecks were found.   
  5. That the servant of said Hotel Mauritania, Euphemia Bochkova, deposited in her name in the local bank of Commerce the sum of eighteen hundred rubles.   
  "And when Euphemia Bochkova was shown her bank account of eighteen hundred rubles," continued the secretary, "and asked how she came by the money, she testified that the money was saved from their earnings by herself and Simon Kartinkin, whom she intended to marry.   
  As to the money placed by Bochkova in the bank, he declared, in accordance with Bochkova's testimony, that they had saved it during their twelve years' service in the hotel. "   
  At the head of the table sat old Korchagin, on his left the physician; on his right, a visitor, Ivan Ivanovich Kolosoff, an ex-district commander, and now a bank manager, who was a friend of the family, and of liberal tendencies; further to the left was Miss Rader, governess to Missy's four-year-old sister, with the little girl herself; then to the right   , Missy's only brother, Peter, a high-school pupil, on account of whose forthcoming examinations the entire family remained in the city, and his tutor, also a student; then again to the left, Katherine Alexeievna, a forty-year-old girl Slavophile; opposite to her was Michael Sergeievich, or Misha Telegin, Missy's cousin, and at the foot of the table, Missy herself, and beside her,on the   table, lay an extra cover.   
  He was an employee of a bank, whose brother was under indictment for forgery.   
  Over this woman stood the bank employee shouting at the top of his voice to a bald-headed prisoner with shining eyes.   
  " Something like a bank; we should have to pay at a fixed time.   
  " If he was resolved to do such a thing, why not sell the land to them through the Peasants' bank?   
  The tall, silent, broad-shouldered, muscular ferryman, dressed in sheepskins, threw the ropes and moored the raft with practised hand, landed the carts that were on it, and put those that were waiting on the bank on board. The whole raft was filled with vehicles and horses shuffling at the sight of the water.   
  The old man noticed that the raft was approaching the bank and stopped, looking round at the bystanders with a look of triumph.   
  CHAPTER XXII.    When they got to the top of the hill bank the driver turned to Nekhludoff.    " Which hotel am I to drive to? "   
  Gurov told her that he came from Moscow, that he had taken his degree in Arts, but had a post in a bank; that he had trained as an opera-singer, but had given it up, that he owned two houses in Moscow.   
  He could not talk to his tenants nor to anyone at the bank.   
  He was sick of his children, sick of the bank; he had no desire to go anywhere or to talk of anything.   
  And through some strange, perhaps accidental, conjunction of circumstances, everything that was essential, of interest and of value to him, everything in which he was sincere and did not deceive himself, everything that made the kernel of his life, was hidden from other people; and all that was false in him, the sheath in which he hid himself to conceal the truth ― such,for   instance, as his work in the bank, his discussions at the club, his 'lower race', his presence with his wife at anniversary festivities – all that was open.   
  It was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.   
  The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted.   
   "No, sir," and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray. Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I was still standing on the bank by the side of the road.   
   In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway across. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to the village of Shepperton.   
   Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously.   
   The hot water from the Martian's overthrow drifted downstream with me, so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank.   
  A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.   
  At last, as the bridge at Walton was coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick, amid the long grass.   
   Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape.   
  A great bank of dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every description.   
  Far ahead of them they could just see the windmills of the village of Mironositskoe; on the right stretched a row of hillocks which disappeared in the distance behind the village, and they both knew that this was the bank of the river, that there were meadows, green willows, homesteads there, and that if one stood on one of the hillocks one could see   from it the same vast plain, telegraph-wires, and a train which in the distance looked like a crawling caterpillar, and that in clear weather one could even see the town.   
  He lived parsimoniously, was frugal in food and drink, his clothes were beyond description; he looked like a beggar, but kept on saving and putting money in the bank.   
  He went on living frugally after marrying her, and kept her short of food, while he put her money in the bank in his name.   
  From the village, which stood up high on the steep river-bank, its trellis-like skeleton could be seen, and in foggy weather and on still winter days, when its delicate iron girders and all the scaffolding around was covered with hoar frost, it presented a picturesque and even fantastic spectacle.   
  They bought sixty acres of land, and on the high bank in a field, where in earlier days the cows of Obrutchanovo used to wander, they built a pretty house of two storeys with a terrace and a verandah, with a tower and a flagstaff on which a flag fluttered on Sundays ― they built it in about three months, and then all the winter   they were planting big trees, and when spring came and everything began to be green there were already avenues to the new house, a gardener and two labourers in white aprons were digging near it, there was a little fountain, and a globe of looking-glass flashed so brilliantly that it was painful to look at.   
  The nightingales were singing in the bushes on the bank, larks were trilling in the heavens.   
  It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed.   
  He went on," And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be haped here, snod an' snog "?    I assented again.    " Then that be just where the lie comes in.    Why, there be scores of these laybeds that be toom as old Dun's `baccabox on Friday night ".    He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed.    " And, my gog!    How could they be otherwise?    Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank, read it "!    I went over and read," Edward Spencelagh, master marin- er, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, age 30 ".    When I came back MrSwales went on," Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here?    Murdered off the coast of Andres!    An' you consated his body lay under!    Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above, "he pointed northwards," or where the currants may have drifted them.    There be the steans around ye.    Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small print of the lies from here.   
  But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased.    They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies.    The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion.   
  A second less and the trenchant blade had shorn through his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank notes and a stream of gold fell out.   
  He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International bank.   
  " And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land, "said MrMorris.   
  While you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's country.   
  They are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves.   
   When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its bank Holiday, a short, thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst.   
   "But this brought matters to a crisis. I did not know what he would do, nor even what he had power to do. To move to fresh apartments would have meant delay; altogether I had barely twenty pounds left in the world, ― for the most part in the bank, ― and I could not afford that. Vanish! It was irresistible. Then there would be an   inquiry, the sacking of my room ―   
  Low down over the meadow floated a drowsy hawk, the river looked gloomy; there was a haze hovering over it here and there, but on the further bank a streak of light already stretched across the hill, the church was gleaming, and in the manor garden the rooks were cawing furiously.   
  Fyokla, young and vigorous as a girl, with her black eyebrows and her loose hair, jumped off the bank and began splashing the water with her feet, and waves ran in all directions from her.   
  In the summer it was a little stream easily crossed by wading. It usually dried up in August, but now, after the spring floods, it was a river forty feet in breadth, rapid, muddy, and cold; on the bank and right up to the water there were fresh tracks of wheels, so it had been crossed here.   
  "Go on!"    They got out on the bank.    "Nice mess it is, Lord have mercy upon us!" muttered Semyon, setting straight the harness.   
   Mowgli laughed. "Yes, we be great hunters now," said he. "I am very bold ― to eat grubs," and the two came down together through the crackling undergrowth to the river-bank and the lace-work of shoals that ran out from it in every direction.   
   On the level plain of the farther bank the stiff jungle-grass had died standing, and, dying, had mummied. The beaten tracks of the deer and the pig, all heading toward the river, had striped that colourless plain with dusty gullies driven through the ten-foot grass, and, early as it was, each long avenue was full of first-comers hastening to the water   . You could hear the does and fawns coughing in the snuff-like dust.   
  Below him a little were the vanguard of the deer; below these, again, the pig and the wild buffalo; and on the opposite bank, where the tall trees came down to the water's edge, was the place set apart for the Eaters of Flesh ― the tiger, the wolves, the panther, the bear, and the others.   
   "Ugh!" said Mysa, the leader of the buffaloes, from their sand-bank.   
   "They throw a thing that cuts now," said Ikki, rustling down the bank; for Ikki was considered uncommonly good eating by the Gonds ― they called him Ho-Igoo ― and he knew something of the wicked little Gondee axe that whirls across a clearing like a dragon-fly.   
   Mowgli swam to bank, rolled on the grass to dry himself, and the two set off for Cold Lairs, the deserted city of which you may have heard.   
   "Hear the Outlier!" said Mowgli with a laugh. Free People, we must go north and dig lizards and rats from the bank, lest by any chance we meet the dhole. He must kill out our hunting-grounds, while we lie hid in the north till it please him to give us our own again. He is a dog ― and the pup of a dog ―red   , yellow-bellied, lairless, and haired between every toe! He counts his cubs six and eight at the litter, as though he were Chikai, the little leaping rat.   
   "Here is this season's kill," said he. "Look!" On the bank lay the skeletons of a couple of young deer and a buffalo.   
   He loosed his arm from the python's neck and went down the gorge like a log in a freshet, paddling toward the far bank, where he found slack-water, and laughing aloud from sheer happiness.   
   A wolf came running along the bank on three legs, leaping up and down, laying his head sideways close to the ground, hunching his back, and breaking high into the air, as though he were playing with his cubs. It was Won-tolla, the Outlier, and he said never a word, but continued his horrible sport beside the dholes. They had been long in   the water now, and were swimming wearily, their coats drenched and heavy, their bushy tails dragging like sponges, so tired and shaken that they, too, were silent, watching the pair of blazing eyes that moved abreast.   
   It was the blunt-nosed Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut, older than any man in the village, who had given his name to the village; the demon of the ford before the railway bridge, came ― murderer, man-eater, and local fetish in one. He lay with his chin in the shallows, keeping his place by an almost invisible rippling of his tail, and well the Jackal   knew that one stroke of that same tail in the water would carry the Mugger up the bank with the rush of a steam-engine.   
   The old brute pushed and panted and grunted up the bank, mumbling, "Respect the aged and infirm!" and all the time his little eyes burned like coals under the heavy, horny eyelids on the top of his triangular head, as he shoved his bloated barrel-body along between his crutched legs.   
  I went no farther, but that gave me three in one day ― well-fed manjis (boatmen) all, and, except in the case of the last (then I was careless), never a cry to warn those on the bank."   
  "The river has shifted even in my little life." Indian rivers are nearly always moving about in their beds, and will shift, sometimes, as much as two or three miles in a season, drowning the fields on one bank, and spreading good silt on the other.   
  They light a little fire ― ah! how well I know that fire! ― and they drink tobacco, and they nod their heads together forward in a ring, or sideways toward the dead man upon the bank.   
   "That little white child which I did not get," said the Mugger, with a deep sigh. "He was very small, but I have not forgotten. I am old now, but before I die it is my desire to try one new thing. It is true they are a heavy-footed, noisy, and foolish people, and the sport would be small, but I remember the old   days above Benares, and, if the child lives, he will remember still. It may be he goes up and down the bank of some river, telling how he once passed his hands between the teeth of the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut, and lived to make a tale of it. My Fate has been very kind, but that plagues me sometimes in my dreams ― the   thought of the little white child in the bows of that boat." He yawned, and closed his jaws. "And now I will rest and think. Keep silent, my children, and respect the aged."   
  Haul that head up the bank, and we'll boil it for the skull.   
   I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock.   
  The horse gave a start and quickly climbed out onto the frozen bank.   
  Having found the whip he tried to climb straight up the bank where he had rolled down, but it was impossible to do so: he kept rolling down again, and so he had to go along at the foot of the hollow to find a way up.   
   Then the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go down into the valley ― not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes down a steep bank ― in one rush.   
  To-day I was served heir to my position in life, a landed laird, a bank porter by me carrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the saying) the ball directly at my foot.   
  Rankeillor's son was short and small in the girth; his clothes scarce held on me; and it was plain I was ill qualified to strut in the front of a bank-porter.   
  Here I am, and a bank-porter at my tail.   
  I think it was the bank-porter that put me from this ungallant train of thought.   
  One thing I learned long after, the hours of the Sunday had been well employed, the bank porter had been found and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart was discovered, and the deduction made that I was pretty deep with James and Alan, and most likely in a continued correspondence with the last.   
  They would get a bonny shot from the top of that lang sandy bank.   
  Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.   
  I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to 88 pounds l0s., while he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties bank.   
  And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find.   
  They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.   
  Dyudya rents some bits of land, keeps a tavern on the highroad, does a trade in tar, honey, cattle, and jackdaws, and has already something like eight thousand roubles put by in the bank in the town.   
  Harris and I would go down in the morning, and take the boat up to Chertsey, and George, who would not be able to get away from the City till the afternoon (George goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day, except Saturdays, when they wake him up and put him outside at two), would meet us there.   
  From the dim woods on either bank, Night's ghostly army, the grey shadows, creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering rear-guard of the light, and pass, with noiseless, unseen feet, above the waving river-grass, and through the sighing rushes; and Night, upon her sombre throne, folds her black wings above the darkening world, and, from her phantom palace,lit   by the pale stars, reigns in stillness.   
  Years later, to the crash of battle-music, Saxon kings and Saxon revelry were buried side by side, and Kingston's greatness passed away for a time, to rise once more when Hampton Court became the palace of the Tudors and the Stuarts, and the royal barges strained at their moorings on the river's bank, and bright-cloaked gallants swaggered down the water-steps to   cry: "What Ferry, ho, Gadzooks, gramercy.   
  It was difficult to say, for the moment, which was us and which was the Middlesex bank of the river; but we found out after a while, and separated ourselves.   
  you lie down on your ― I mean you lean over the bank, you know, and sloush the things about in the water.   
  Why couldn't he have got the day off, and come down with us?    bank be blowed!    What good was he at the bank?   
  What good was he at the bank?   
  I don't believe he's at the bank at all.   
  It was right at the bottom of the hamper, and seemed difficult to find, and he had to lean over further and further, and, in trying to steer at the same time, from a topsy-turvy point of view, he pulled the wrong line, and sent the boat into the bank, and the shock upset him, and he dived down right into the hamper,and   stood there on his head, holding on to the sides of the boat like grim death, his legs sticking up into the air.   
  They drive posts into the bed of the stream, and draw chains across from bank to bank, and nail huge notice-boards on every tree.   
  The other forty thousand I would put in the bank and get interest on it."   
  Beyond the marsh, on the bank of the Pestchanka, of which the old man had spoken, stood a row of willows, and beyond the willows a barn looked dark blue in the mist.   
  "Lord save us and have mercy upon us!    I was walking along the river bank one day to Novopavlovka.    A storm was gathering, such a tempest it was, preserve us Holy Mother, Queen of Heaven…   
  At times he would walk along the river bank or in the forest, and under the bushes and under the rocks there would be little flames, little flames…   
  The hand of Providence brought me in my drifting to the very doors of the British Linen Company's bank.   
  ' So we all set of, the doctor, and the child's father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank.   
  A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit, completed his gratification.   
  We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbills.   
  But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening anaccount at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.   
  Behind it Savka's dog Kutka stood out like a black patch, and not a dozen feet from Kutka the ground ended abruptly in the steep bank of the little river.   
  Lying down I could not see the river; I could only see the tops of the young willows growing thickly on the nearer bank, and the twisting, as it were gnawed away, edges of the opposite bank.   
  At a distance beyond the bank on the dark hillside the huts of the village in which Savka lived lay huddling together like frightened young partridges.   
  And at once, as though in answer to his call, a landrail called on the opposite bank.   
  The further bank and the village could not be seen.   
  I felt my way along the bank, found a hollow place which I had noticed in the daylight, and sat down in it as in an arm-chair.   
  Agafya stepped upon the bank and went across the fields to the village.   
  The rivers there are wide and rapid, the banks are steep ― awfully!    It's all slumbering forests on the bank.    The trees are so tall that if you look to the top it makes you dizzy.   
  Slowly and quietly the fancy pictures how early in the morning, before the flush of dawn has left the sky, a man makes his way along the steep deserted bank like a tiny speck: the ancient, mast-like pines rise up in terraces on both sides of the torrent, gaze sternly at the free man and murmur menacingly; rocks, huge stones, and thorny bushes   bar his way, but he is strong in body and bold in spirit, and has no fear of the pine-trees, nor stones, nor of his solitude, nor of the reverberating echo which repeats the sound of every footstep that he takes.   
  They stood in a crowd on the river-bank, gazed like sheep at the bridge, and did not concern themselves to know who had built it.   
  " 'Do you know who that lady is, walking on the other bank?   
  That is N. N., the famous Tula cardsharper who was had up in connection with the Y. bank affair."   
  Some students and peasants who chanced to pass during the next hour were much astonished to see the worthy Professor of Physiology and his favourite student both sitting upon a very muddy bank and both completely insensible.   
  As I stood at my diamond-paned lattice still peering and peeping to make out what this might be, a great bank of clouds rolled slowly away from the face of the moon, and a flood of cold, clear light was poured down upon the silent bay and the long sweep of its desolate shores.   
  Into this the elephants plunged, and when we reached the edge we found them struggling in wild confusion to get up the other bank, filling the air with their screams, and trumpeting as they pushed one another aside in their selfish panic, just like so many human beings.   
  Now was our opportunity, and firing away as quickly as we could load, we killed five of the poor beasts, and no doubt should have bagged the whole herd, had they not suddenly given up their attempts to climb the bank and rushed headlong down the nullah.   
  Then we smoked a pipe, and lay down by the side of that blessed pool, under the overhanging shadow of its bank, and slept till noon.   
  Presently I missed Good, and I looked to see what had become of him. Soon I observed him sitting by the bank of the stream, in which he had been bathing.   
  On the day of their arrival he was sitting by the stream, and Jim was extracting the honey from the nest of a stingless bee which is to be found in the desert, on the top of a bank immediately above him.   
  They took him and buried him on the bank.   
  He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.   
  I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along.   
  I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.   
  About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.   
  I stood on the bank and looked out over the river.   
  It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.   
  The next minute I was a spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank.   
  I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.   
  When she'd got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.   
  He was lying face downwards upon a frozen bank.   
  We were just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder.   
  I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch.   
  MY curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not remain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering my head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our door.   
  That ain't bad for a man before the mast―all safe in bank.   
  I knew a young lady of the last “romantic” generation who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she might quite easily have married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to   satisfy her own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's Ophelia. Indeed, if this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most likely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or   three generations.   
  And that's not all, either. I can tell you more than that. I know that for the last five days he has had three thousand drawn out of the bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large envelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape.   
  In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over Russia with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen. A good-looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant's barge along the bank.   
  “I want to lose a lot to you.    Take your cards. Make the bank.”    “We'll have cards from the landlord, panie,” said the little Pole, gravely and emphatically.   
  “The pan had no luck, perhaps he'll be lucky this time,” the Pole on the sofa observed in his direction.    “How much in the bank?    To correspond?” asked Mitya.   
  “In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it.   
  Podvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the bank.   
  ‘Take it, panie, ' says the banker, and pulling out the drawer he gives him a million. ‘Take it, panie, this is your gain.'    There was a million in the bank.    ‘I didn't know that, ' says Podvysotsky.   
  In her family's eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in society, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two, were already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director of a bank and railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky. But he (he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country gentleman   , occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit for nothing else.   
  There was no place where they could bathe; the whole of the river-bank was trampled by the cattle and open to the road; even walks were impossible, for the cattle strayed into the garden through a gap in the hedge, and there was one terrible bull, who bellowed, and therefore might be expected to gore somebody.   
  He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river.   
  This influence was due to his wealth and reputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend Shirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a nourishing bank in Kashin, the excellent cook Vronsky had brought from the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a schoolfellow of Vronsky's―a schoolfellow he   had patronized and protected indeed. But what contributed more than all to his success was his direct, equable manner with every one, which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness.   
  They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal of the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of "our amiable host."   
  " Oh, all right, I'll go to the bank and get some.   
  Only one thing was essential: to have money in the bank, without inquiring where it came from, so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for to-morrow.   
  And this condition had hitherto been fulfilled; he had always had the money in the bank.   
  But now the money in the bank had gone, and he could not quite tell where to get the next installment.   
  Petrov, the bank director, had twelve thousand; Sventitsky, a company director, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank, received fifty thousand.   
  "Suppose a bank director gets ten thousand―well, he's worth it; or an engineer gets twenty thousand―after all, it's a growing thing, you know!"   
  They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour… which was midnight.   
  While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nookin the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward.   
  They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water.   
  Shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.   
  He crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did" yawl "duty at the boat's stern.   
  The boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank.   
  They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods.   
  Used to measure his money in half-pint cups. They say now that she've business in every bank in Casterbridge, and thinks no more of playing pitch-and-toss sovereign than you and I, do pitch-halfpenny ― not a bit in the world, shepherd.»   
  "Ay, sure." said his son, a young man about sixtyfive, with a semi-bald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw, which made much of itself by standing prominent, like a milestone in a bank.   
  She waited one minute ― two minutes ― thought of Troy's disappointment at her non-fulfilment of a promised engagement, till she again ran along the field, clambered over the bank, and followed the original direction.   
  Freshness was exhaled in an essence from the varied contours of bank and hollow, as if the earth breathed maiden breath; and the pleased birds were hymning to the scene.   
  She had passed the last milestone by a good long distance, and began to look wistfully towards the bank as if calculating upon another milestone soon.   
  He turned the horse's head to the green bank, and entered the hostel for a mug of ale.   
  Like a homeless wanderer she lingered by the bank, as if lulled and fascinated by the atmosphere of content which seemed to spread from that little dwelling, and was so sadly lacking in her own.   
  To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a winding road ascended, and the level green space of ten or fifteen acres enclosed by the bank was the site of the fair.   
  Then, with the lightning action in which he was such an adept, he noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the tent-cloth, which was far from being pinned tightly down, lifted it a little way, keeping his eye to the hole, snatched the note from her fingers, dropped the canvas, and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch,smiling   at the scream of astonishment which burst from her.   
  It was supposed that the rogue had imagined a slip of paper which she held in her hand to he a bank note, for he had seized it, and made off with it, leaving her purse behind.   
  Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was a long while making his way between the fences, keeping close to the river bank, but finding his way confidently, and scarcely giving it a thought indeed.   
  They crossed the bridge like this and came out on to the river bank, turning this time to the left, again into a long deserted back street, which led to the centre of the town by a shorter way than going through Bogoyavlensky Street.   
  But why are you so alarmed? Why, Yulia Mihailovna told me you always have several copies made—one kept at a notary's abroad, another in Petersburg, a third in Moscow, and then you send some to a bank, I believe. "   
  Two hundred paces to the right was the bank of the third pond of the park.   
  "That's true indeed," the woman put in with animation, "for if you drive along the bank it's twenty-five miles out of the way.   
   Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife.   
   'How CAN you go on talking so quietly, head downwards? ' Alice asked, as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.   
  " My word, he has been going it!» someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank.   
  He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back.   
  He wandered along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps' edge, and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people were swarming everywhere.   
  He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov.   
  To go with false notes into a bank where it's their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I should not have the face to do it.   
  Bending over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to catch his attention. 
  Well, it's a way out of it," he thought, walking slowly and listlessly along the canal bank.   
  When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on the pavement.   
  Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia lived.   
  Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt.   
   ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"   
   THEY were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank ― the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.   
   At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the   trees upon her face.   
  On a bright December morning long ago, two thinly clad children were kneeling upon the bank of a frozen canal in Holland.   
  Men, women, and children go clattering about in wooden shoes with loose heels; peasant girls who cannot get beaux for love, hire them for money to escort them to the kermis, and husbands and wives lovingly harness themselves side by side on the bank of the canal and drag their pakschuyts to market.   
  Nothing could be straighter than the canal upon which our party were skating, and nothing straighter than the long rows of willow trees that stood, bare and wispy, along the bank.   
  The Terek, which separates the Cossacks from the mountaineers, still flows turbid and rapid though already broad and smooth, always depositing greyish sand on its low reedy right bank and washing away the steep, though not high, left bank, with its roots of century-old oaks, its rotting plane trees, and young brushwood.   
  On the right bank lie the villages of pro-Russian, though still somewhat restless, Tartars. Along the left bank, back half a mile from the river and standing five or six miles apart from one another, are Cossack villages.   
  On the low bank, a little to one side, could be seen the flat-roofed clay houses and the funnel-shaped chimneys of a Chechen village.   
  The corporal, a tall thin Cossack with an exceptionally long back and small hands and feet, was sitting on the earth-bank of a hut with his beshmet unbuttoned. On his face was the lazy, bored expression of a superior, and having shut his eyes he dropped his head upon the palm first of one hand and then of the other.   
  Others, also overcome by the heat and half naked, were rinsing clothes in the Terek, plaiting a fishing line, or humming tunes as they lay on the hot sand of the river bank.   
  'Had a good day, good people, eh? ' he said, addressing the Cossacks in the same strong and cheerful voice, quite without effort, but as loudly as if he were shouting to someone on the other bank of the river.   
  On its bank lay a thick black log cast up by the water. The reeds around it had been recently beaten down.   
  Lukashka pulled his cloak up higher and walked back alone, throwing swift glances now to the left at the wall of reeds, now to the Terek rushing by below the bank.   
  From under the bank a boar leapt up―his dark outline showing for a moment against the glassy surface of the water and then disappearing among the reeds.   
  Close in front at his very feet was the bank, and at its base the rushing torrent.   
  'All of a sudden, loud clamour, laughter, torches, tambourines on the bank….   
  The girls have ceased singing their hymn—they cannot go on with it, but they do not stir, the river carries them to the bank.   
  There is nothing but the sound of their shrill cry, and her wreath left lying on the bank.   
  We rode through all the boulevards, reached the 'Maidens' Field, ' jumped several fences (at first I had been afraid to take a leap, but my father had a contempt for cowards, and I soon ceased to feel fear), twice crossed the river Moskva, and I was under the impression that we were on our way home, especially as my father of his own accord   observed that my horse was tired, when suddenly he turned off away from me at the Crimean ford, and galloped along the river-bank.   
  I began walking up and down the river-bank, leading the horses, and scolding Electric, who kept pulling, shaking her head, snorting and neighing as she went; and when I stood still, never failed to paw the ground, and whining, bite my cob on the neck; in fact she conducted herself altogether like a spoilt thorough-bred.   
  My heart sinking with panic, with a sort of awe-struck horror, I rushed back, and running down the lane, almost letting go my hold of Electric, went back to the bank of the river.   
  "There is nothing to apprehend.    I belong to Tellson's bank.    You must know Tellson's bank in London.   
  You must know Tellson's bank in London.   
  While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of HER   private topics of uneasiness.   
  Tellson's bank had a run upon it in the mail.   
  As the bank passenger ― with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt ― nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle   of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business.   
  But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night.   
  Dig ― dig ― dig ― until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.   
  A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson's bank.   
  But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.   
  We found Annouchka upon the bank; she was talking with the boatman.   
  The boat was set loose from the bank, and the current carried it along with rapidity.   
  The boat reached the shore; I jumped out of it and looked behind me, but I no longer saw any one on the other bank.   
  The reflection of the moon spread out again, like a bridge of gold, from one bank of the river to the other.   
  The sighing of the wind in my ears, the rippling of the water, which made a wake behind the stern, irritated me, and the cold air from over the water did not refresh me. A nightingale began to sing near the river bank, and the sweetness of the melodious voice ran through me like a delicious and burning poison.   
  At the hour agreed upon I crossed the Rhine, and the first person I met on the bank was the same little boy who had found me in the morning.   
  " Yes, "I replied, and walked along the river bank.   
  I hastened down the path that passed through the vineyards and entered the town; after hurrying through all the streets and looking in every direction, even at Dame Louise's windows, I came back to the Rhine, and ran along the river bank.   
  I often remember that at the moment when the steamboat left the shore, and when I said farewell to all those streets, to all those places that I should never forget, I perceived Hannchen, the little servant-maid.    She was seated upon a bench near the river bank:    though yet pale, her face was no longer sorrowful. A handsome young fellow was by her side and laughing with her, whilst at the other side of the Rhine my little Madonna, concealed in the dark foliage of the old ash, followed me sadly with her glance.   
  Pavel Dmitrievitch, who had always been calm and leisurely, a genuine gambler, and a man of means, was now very different from what he had been in the flowery days of his success; he seemed to be in haste to go somewhere, kept constantly glancing at everybody, and it was not five minutes before he proposed to Lieutenant O., who had sworn off from   playing, to set up a small faro-bank.   
  From Nicola (for Papa never spoke to us of his gambling) I had learnt that he (Papa) had been very fortunate in play that winter, and so had won an extraordinary amount of money, all of which he had placed in the bank after vowing that he would play no more that spring.   
  On the further side of a small lake, over-grown with weeds round its edges, rose a steep ascent covered with bushes and with huge old trees of many shades of green, while, overhanging the lake at the foot of the ascent, stood an ancient birch tree which, though partly supported by stout roots implanted in the marshy bank of the lake, rested its   crown upon a tall, straight poplar, and dangled its curved branches over the smooth surface of the pond―both branches and the surrounding greenery being reflected therein as in a mirror.   
  Next, I would stretch myself on the grass and read―raising my eyes from time to time to look at the surface of the river where it showed blue in the shade of the trees, at the ripples caused by the first morning breeze, at the yellowing field of rye on the further bank, and at the bright-red sheen of the sunlight as   it struck lower and lower down the white trunks of the birch-trees which, ranged in ranks one behind the other, gradually receded into the remote distance of the home park. At such moments I would feel joyously conscious of having within me the same young, fresh force of life as nature was everywhere exuding around me.   
  He thought of the amenities of a life, of friendship, and of how nice it would be to live with a comrade on, say, the bank of some river, and to span the river with a bridge of his own, and to build an enormous mansion with a facade lofty enough even to afford a view to Moscow, on that facade he and his   wife and friend would drink afternoon tea in the open air, and discuss interesting subjects.   
  Had I only played the right card, I should have broken the bank».   
  Had I only played the right card, I should have broken the bank».    " But you did NOT break the bank, 'remarked the flaxen-haired man.    "No, that was because I did not play my cards right.   
  "How would it be if, to pass the time, I were to make a bank of three hundred»?   
  "But chess is different from playing with a bank; in chess there can be neither luck nor cheating, for everything depends upon skill; in fact, I warn you that I cannot possibly play with you unless you allow me a move or two in advance».   
  True, as one walks the streets of St.Petersburg one seems to smell money by the thousand roubles, but our friend Kopeikin's bank was limited to a few score coppers and a little silver ― not enough to buy a village with!   
  Then a constable who had been called to the door-a constable three ells in height, and armed with a carbine.    A man well fitted to guard a bank ― placed our friend in a police waggon.    'Well, ' reflected Kopeikin, 'at least I shan't have to pay my fare for THIS ride, that's one comfort.   
  All of a sudden he fancied something was floundering in the mud close to the bank.   
  At the Crimean Ford, he turned along the bank, went to a place where there were two little rowing-boats fastened to stakes (he had noticed them there before), and jumped into one of them with Mumu.   
  Meadows stretched each side of the bank, market gardens, fields, and copses; peasants' huts began to make their appearance.   
  Gerasim heard nothing, neither the quick shrill whine of Mumu as she fell, nor the heavy splash of the water; for him the noisiest day was soundless and silent as even the stillest night is not silent to us. When he opened his eyes again, little wavelets were hurrying over the river, chasing one another; as before they broke against the boat's side,and   only far away behind wide circles moved widening to the bank.   
  There goes three thousand dollars, men!    -a bank!    -a whole bank!   
  -a bank!    -a whole bank!    The bank of England!   
  -a whole bank!    The bank of England!    -Oh, do, do, do!   
  And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote.   
  I understood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.   
  A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her.   
  She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she couldn't be still a minute.   
  'Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.'   
  On one side of the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal.   
  He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.   
  At times the night sky was illumined in spots by the glare of burning reeds along pools or river-bank; and dark flights of swans flying to the north were suddenly lit up by the silvery, rose-coloured gleam, till it seemed as though red kerchiefs were floating in the dark heavens.   
  They galloped along the course of a small stream, called the Tatarka, which falls into the Dnieper; rode into the water and swam with their horses some distance in order to conceal their trail, then, scrambling out on the bank, they continued their road.   
  The blows and shouts of the workers rose all over the neighbour hood; the bank shook and moved about.   
  They crossed the brook on a small plank, beyond which rose the opposite bank, which appeared higher than the one behind them and rose steeply.   
  The steep bank was overgrown with steppe-grass, and in the narrow ravine between it and the brook grew tall reeds almost as high as a man.   
  At the summit of the bank were the remains of a wattled fence, which had formerly surrounded some garden, and in front of it were visible the wide leaves of the burdock.   
  But this time Pototzky was also equal to the task intrusted to him; unweariedly he followed them, and overtook them on the bank of the Dniester, where Taras had taken possession of an abandoned and ruined castle for the purpose of resting.   
  He saw the sterns of four boats peeping out from behind some bushes; exerted all the power of his lungs, and shouted in a ringing tone:    " To the bank!    to the bank, men!   
  " To the bank!    to the bank, men!    descend the path to the left, under the cliff.   
  There are boats on the bank; take all, that they may not catch you ".   
  His hind hoofs slipped back off the opposite bank, and he remained hanging by his fore-feet; I dropped the bridle and threw myself into the hollow, thereby saving my horse, which jumped out.   
  I heard in the darkness a horse trotting along the bank of the hollow, snorting, neighing, and beating the ground with his hoofs, I recognised my Karagyoz's voice; 'twas he, my comrade "!   
  Here and there, behind the trees, I caught glimpses of a number of poor, low houses straggling along the bank of the Terek, which flowed seaward in an ever-widening stream; farther off rose the dark-blue, jagged wall of the mountains, behind which Mount Kazbek gazed forth in his highpriest's hat of white.   
  When we made our way out on the bank, the horses were all put to the trot.   
  Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.   
  There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of 'The George.'   
  It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank.   
  'Is it much farther? ' asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.   
  'A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.'   
  'Number and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the bank?   
  He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky.   
  'He had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him; his garments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the new-comer; and Edmunds raised his head.'   
  I was borne upon the arms of demons who swept along upon the wind, and bore down bank and hedge before them, and spun me round and round with a rustle and a speed that made my head swim, until at last they threw me from them with a violent shock, and I fell heavily upon the earth.   
  'It IS matter of wonder, though, that anyone of Mr.Nathaniel Pipkin's retiring disposition, nervous temperament, and most particularly diminutive income, should from this day forth, have dared to aspire to the hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old Lobbs ― of old Lobbs, the great saddler, who could have bought up the whole village at one stroke of his pen   , and never felt the outlay ― old Lobbs, who was well known to have heaps of money, invested in the bank at the nearest market town ― who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible treasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big keyhole, over the chimney-piece in the back parlour ― and who, it was well known, on festive occasions garnished his board   with a real silver teapot, cream-ewer, and sugar-basin, which he was wont, in the pride of his heart, to boast should be his daughter's property when she found a man to her mind.   
  His money always as good as the bank ― always! '   
  Mr. Winkle, stooping forward, with his body half doubled up, was being assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a very singular and un-swan-like manner, when Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite bank ― 'Sam! '   
  There was a quick rush towards the bank, a wild scream from the ladies, and a shout from Mr. Tupman.   
  'Three per cent consolidated bank annuities, now standing in her name in the book or books of the governor and company of the bank of England, ' added Bob Sawyer, in legal phraseology.   
  At length all these weighty matters being arranged, a day was fixed for selling out and transferring the stock, and of waiting with that view upon Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, stock-broker, of somewhere near the bank, who had been recommended by Mr.Solomon Pell for the purpose.   
  The office of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, of the Stock Exchange, was in a first floor up a court behind the bank of England; the house of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was at Brixton, Surrey; the horse and stanhope of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, were at an adjacent livery stable; the groom of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, was on his way to the West End to deliver some   game; the clerk of Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, had gone to his dinner; and so Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, himself, cried, 'Come in, ' when Mr.Pell and his companions knocked at the counting-house door.   
  Wilkins Flasher, Esquire, now condescended to receive Mr.Solomon Pell's instructions, and having filled up some printed forms, requested the party to follow him to the bank, which they did:   
  The Corporal led me to a cabin placed on the high bank near the river's edge, at the end of the fortress.   
  I saw in the distance a village well known to my eyes, with its palisade and church spire on the steep bank of the river Iaik; a quarter of an hour after we entered the fortress of Belogorsk.   
  The sentinels had not time to stop me―and burst into the room where six hussar officers were playing faro.    The Major kept the bank.    I instantly recognized the Major as Ivan Zourine, who had so thoroughly emptied my purse at Simbirsk.   
  A double stockade, or palisade, composed of pointed beams, which the adjacent forest supplied, defended the outer and inner bank of the trench.   
  They paused on the top of a gently rising bank, and the Pilgrim, pointing to the town of Sheffield, which lay beneath them, repeated the words, "Here, then, we part».   
  Gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been dragged somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the lane, found himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and the open common.   
  When thou hast crossed the ford, thou wilt take care of thy footing up the left bank, as it is somewhat precipitous; and the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as I learn, (for I seldom leave the duties of my chapel,) given way in sundry places.   
  Nevertheless, it is of verity that they assemble a camp, and raise a bank against the walls of this castle''.   
  Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.
